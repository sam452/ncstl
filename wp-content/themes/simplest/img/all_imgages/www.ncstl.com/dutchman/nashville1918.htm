            <p>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION.</p>
            <p>REPORT OF THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY COVERING THE INVESTIGATION 
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; 
              ST. LOUIS RAILWAY AT NASHVILLE, TENN., ON JULY 9, 1918.</p>
            <p>AUGUST 16, 1918.</p>
            <p>To the Commission:</p>
            <p>On July 9, 1918, there was a head-end collision between two passenger 
              trains on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway at 
              Nashville, Tenn., which resulted in the death of 87 passengers and 
              14 employees. and the injury of 87 passengers and 14 employees. 
              After investigation the following report is submitted:</p>
            <p>That part of the Nashville division of the Nashville, Chattanooga 
              &amp; St. Louis Railway upon which this accident occurred is a single-track 
              line over which trains are operated by time table and train orders, 
              there being no block system in use. Between Nashville and Shops, 
              a distance of 2.5 miles, it is a double-track line, and at Shops 
              there is an interlocking plant which controls all main line switches 
              there. The accident occurred about half way between Shops and Harding, 
              located 2.5 and 6.8 mils, respectively, from the station at Nashville, 
              and within the city limits of Nashville.</p>
            <p>The trains involved in this accident are shown on the time table 
              as southbound passenger train No. 1 and northbound passenger train 
              No. 4, but in the vicinity of the point of accident, southbound 
              trains run practically north and northbound trains practically south. 
              Soutbound trains are superior to northbound trains. Train No. 4 
              is scheduled to leave Nashville at 7 a.m., and train No. 1 is scheduled 
              to arrive at Nashville at 7.10 a.m.</p>
            <p>Train No. 1 consisted of locomotive 281, one baggage car and five 
              coached of wooden construction, one Pullman sleeping car of steel 
              construction and one Pullman sleeping car with steel underframe 
              and ends, in the order named, and was in charge of Conductor Tucker 
              and Engineman Lloyd. It was enroute from Memphis to Nashville, being 
              operated over the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad from Memphis 
              to McKenzie, and the remainder of the distance over the Nashville, 
              Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway. It left McKenzie at 3 a.m., 
              passed Bellevue, 12.6 miles from Nashville, at 7.09 a.m., 30 minutes 
              late, and at about 7.20 a.m. collided head on with train No. 4 at 
              a point about 4.5 miles from Nashville, while running at a speed 
              estimated at about 50 miles an hour. Fig. 1 is a general view of 
              the wreck.</p>
            <p>Train No. 4 consisted of locomotive 282, one combination mail and 
              baggage car, one baggage car and 6 coaches, in the order named and 
              all of wooden construction, and was in charge of Conductor Eubank 
              and Engineman Kennedy. At Nashville the crew received train order 
              No. 29 reading as follows:</p>
            <p>No. 4 engine 282, hold main track, meet No. 7, Eng. 215, at Harding. 
              No. 1 has engine 281.</p>
            <p>This train left Nashville at 7.07 a.m. 7 minutes late, passed Shops 
              at 7.15 a.m., and collided with train No. 1 at a point about 2 miles 
              beyond Shops while running at a speed estimated to have been about 
              50 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>The engineman and firemen of both trains were killed. Locomotive 
              281 was derailed on the west side of the track, the boiler being 
              stripped of cab, machinery and appurtenances, and came to rest in 
              an upright position at an angle of about 45 degrees with the track; 
              it is shown in Fig. 3. Its frame and all machinery were practically 
              demolished. The baggage car was completely demolished. The first 
              coach lay crosswise the track, the combination car of train No. 
              4 being driven into its side near the center and its rear end torn 
              completely end to a depth of 12 or 15 feet. The second coach was 
              derailed and its forward end went down the bank and rested on the 
              front end of boiler of locomotive 281 and its rear and rested on 
              the roadbed on top of the frame and other parts of locomotive 281, 
              its forward end being badly broken and damaged. The third coach 
              remained on the roadbed with its forward end jammed against the 
              rear of the second coach; the rear trucks of this car and the four 
              following cars were not derailed. All of this equipment was on train 
              No. 1 Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are views of the destroyed equipment.</p>
            <p>Locomotive 282 was derailed to the east side of the track, the 
              boiler thrown from the frame and entirely stripped of all machinery 
              and appurtenances and stopped about parallel with the track, the 
              entire locomotive except the boiler being demolished, as shown by 
              Fig. 3. The forward half of the combination car was demolished by 
              coming in contact with the first coach of train No. 1. The baggage 
              car was completely telescoped with the first coach to its rear, 
              both cars remaining upright, but were practically destroyed, as 
              shown by Fig 4. The end of the second coach was demolished for a 
              distance of 6 or 8 feet and partially telescoped with the rear end 
              of the coach ahead of it. The three rear cars of train No. 4 were 
              not derailed and only slightly damaged.</p>
            <p>Approaching the point of accident from Harding, the track is straight 
              for about 1,800 feet, then there is a 1-degree curve to the right 
              about 2,100 feet long, then a tangent about 1,100 feet long, then 
              a 1-degree curve to the left about 1,300 feet long, then a tangent 
              about 2,000 feet long, then a 2-degree curve to the right about 
              1,500 feet 2,000 feet long, then a 2-degree curve to the right about 
              1,500 feet long, the collision occurring about 900 feet in on this 
              curve. The track just described is laid on a fill and a descending 
              grade varying from 0.3 per cent to 0.7 per cent to within about 
              350 feet of the point of collision. and then the grade is practically 
              level for about 2,000 feet. About 300 feet south of the point of 
              collision, there is an over head highway bridge over the track and 
              just south of the bridge there are heavy woods on the right hand 
              side of the track.</p>
            <p>Approaching the point of accident from the direction of Shops, 
              the track is straight for approximately 4,000 feet, then there is 
              a 3-degree curve to the left about 2,200 feet long, then a tangent 
              about 1,000 feet long which leads to the 2-degree curve on which 
              the collision occurred. The grade descends from 0.7 per cent to 
              1.3 per cent to within about 1,650 feet of the point of collision, 
              and is practically level the remainder of the distance. Between 
              Shops and the point of collision there are several cuts, one of 
              which ends about 300 feet before reaching the point of collision, 
              and has a maximum depth of 15 feet. This cut, the overhead highway 
              bridge and the curve upon which the accident occurred made it practically 
              impossible for the enginemen to see approaching trains is indicated 
              by Fig. 5. The weather at the time was clear.</p>
            <p>Dispatcher Phillips stated that when he missed train order No. 
              29 for train No. 4 to meet train No. 7, he added the information 
              that train No. 1 was being hauled by locomotive 281, it being the 
              custom to advise the crew of train No. 4 of the engine number of 
              train No. 1 in this manner to aid then in identifying that train, 
              and also to advise them that that train had not arrived at Shops. 
              He said trains Nos. 1 and 4 are scheduled to pass on the double 
              track between Nashville and Shops, and in case train No. 4 arrived 
              at Shops before train No. 1, train No. 4 is expected to remain at 
              Shops until train No. 1 arrives, unless the crew receives authority 
              to proceed, train No. 1 being the superior train. He said there 
              was no train register at Shops.</p>
            <p>Conductor Eubank of train No. 4 stated that before leaving the 
              station at Nashville, he received a train order advising that engine 
              281 was hauling train No. 1 and he delivered a copy of that order 
              to Engineman Kennedy who read it back to him. He remarked to Engineman 
              Kennedy that &quot;No. 1 must be some late this morning, but I dont 
              believe the mail is going to delay us so he will have to change 
              that meeting point to Vaughns Gap,&quot; and from the remarks passed 
              between them he supposed Engineman Kennedy knew their train was 
              liable to be detained at Shops to meet train No. 1. Conductor Eubank 
              stated that he read the train order to the train porter just as 
              his train was leaving the station and shortly thereafter, and while 
              his train was still on the double track, he delivered the order 
              to the flagman and told him to look out for train No. 1. He said 
              he knew train No. 1 had not arrived at Shops when he left Nashville 
              and kept that train in mind. He was busy collecting tickets and 
              before reaching the end of the double track, he heard a train pass 
              his train on the opposite track, which he assumed was train No. 
              1, although he could not see it on account of the car in which he 
              was riding being crowded. He said it took all his time and attention 
              to collect the tickets before the next regular stop, and he was 
              depending upon the engineman, fireman, porter and flagman to look 
              out for train No. 1, as was his custom, and stop at Shops in case 
              they did not pass that train. He stated that his train was running 
              at a speed of about 45 miles an hour when he felt the application 
              of the air brakes, followed immediately by the collision. He said 
              he considered Engineman Kennedy careful man of good habits and when 
              talking to him before leaving Nashville, he was apparently in good 
              spirits and normal condition.</p>
            <p>Flagman St. Clair of train No. 4 stated that when his train left 
              Nashville, he was riding on the rear end and when it reached Shops 
              he went forward, asked Conductor Eubank for the train orders, received 
              them, but the conductor said nothing to him about looking out for 
              train No. 1. He said a switch engine with 8 or 10 cars passed his 
              train between Nashville and Shops, moving in the opposite direction, 
              but saw no other trains. He said he had made but two trips as a 
              flagman on a freight train, and this was his first trip as a passenger 
              train flagman.</p>
            <p>Conductor Tucker of train No. 1 stated that his train was running 
              about 30 minutes late, and at a speed of 50 or 60 miles an hour, 
              when the collision occurred, but he felt no application of the air 
              brakes. He said he had received no orders concerning train No. 4, 
              but it being an interior train, he expected it to wait at Shops 
              until his train arrived.</p>
            <p>Conductor Riggle, who alternated with Conductor Eubank on train 
              No. 4, stated that he always kept train No. 1 in mind after leaving 
              Nashville, and made it a special point not to pass Shops unless 
              he personally knew that that train had arrived; on several occasions 
              he had waited Shops until that train arrived. He said he depended 
              upon the flagman, porter, and engine crew to identify train No. 
              1, but would not permit his train to pass Shops unless they advised 
              him it had arrived, or he saw it.</p>
            <p>Engineman Winford, who alternated with Engineman Kennedy on train 
              No. 4, stated that it was sometimes necessary to wait at Shops until 
              train No. 1 arrived. He said he usually finds the signals at Shops 
              set for movement to the single track, but he always waited until 
              the arrival of train No. 1, it being his understanding that the 
              interlocking signals gave his train to rights over superior trains 
              beyond Shops.</p>
            <p>Operator Johnson stated that he went on duty at Shops at about 
              7.06 a.m. or 7.07 a.m., and train No. 4 passed the tower there about 
              7.15 a.m. at a speed of about 25 miles an hour. At that time he 
              did not know whether train No. 1 had arrived, and did not examine 
              the train sheet to see if it had; the first notice he had of its 
              nonarrival was when he saw it was not entered on the train sheet. 
              He said he reported the passage of train No. 4 promptly to the dispatcher, 
              who told him to try and stop that train, as it should have waited 
              for train No. 1, and he sounded the emergency air whistle in an 
              effort to attract the attention of the crew of that train, which 
              was then about a train length away, but the signal was not heeded. 
              When train No. 4 approached the tower, the signal was in the proceed 
              position, but he said that did not give it a right to proceed against 
              train No. 1. He said nothing was said about train No. 1 when he 
              took charge of the tower that morning.</p>
            <p>Traveling Engineer Fahey stated that he considered Engineman Kennedy 
              a very careful man, well posted on the rules, and one who adhered 
              strictly to them. He said he bad observed engineman passing Shops 
              upon the operators word that superior trains had arrived, and as 
              a result, the superintendent issued bulletin No. 1268 under date 
              of May 28, 1918, reading as follows:</p>
            <p>Understand some engineers on outbound trains are passing the Shops 
              without any definite information as to whether superior trains have 
              arrived, other than to ask operator at Shop tower. This must be 
              discontinued.</p>
            <p>Superior trains must either he registered before the northbound 
              train depart or be identified by some member of the crew of the 
              superior train, meet the superior train between Nashville and the 
              Shops or have an order at the Shops stating that the superior has 
              arrived.</p>
            <p>NOTE. -- See that train dispatchers understand this and have the 
              orders ready at the Shops so they can be handed on to the outbound 
              trains.</p>
            <p>This accident was caused by train No. 4 occupying the main track 
              on the time of a superior train, for which Engineman Kennedy and 
              Conductor Eubank were responsible.</p>
            <p>Rule 83 of the operating rules of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; 
              St. Louis Railway provides in part as follows:</p>
            <p>A train must not leave its initial station or any division, or 
              a junction or pass from double to single track, until it has been 
              ascertained whether all trains due which are superior or of the 
              some class, have arrived or left.</p>
            <p>The evidence indicates that Engineman Kennedy and Conductor Eubank 
              had been running on train No. 4 for several years and before leaving 
              Nashville on the morning of the accident they had talked about train 
              No. 1 and knew that it had not arrived, although it was due there 
              at 7.10 a.m., three minutes after their train departed. As Engineman 
              Kennedy was killed in the collision, no evidence could be secured 
              to determine what caused him to overlook train No. 1.</p>
            <p>Conductor Eubank apparently relied wholly upon the other members 
              of the train crew to identify train No. 1 and allowed his train 
              to pass from double track to single track at Shops without making 
              any effort to ascertain whether train No. 1 had arrived. His statement 
              that he was busy collecting tickets and that he passed a train in 
              the yards between Nashville and Shops, which he did not see, but 
              assumed was train No. 1, can not be considered a valid reason for 
              overlooking of failing to identify that train. His first duty was 
              to provide for the safety of his train and see to it that it did 
              not pass from double track to single track before train No. 1 had 
              arrived; and particularly in a yard where switching movements are 
              constantly being made, he was extremely negligent in assuming that 
              a passing train was No. 1 without seeing it and without being notified 
              of its identify by some member of his crew who had seen it.</p>
            <p>While the operating rules of the company required that a train 
              must not pass from double to single track &quot;until it has been 
              ascertained whether all trains due, which are superior, or of the 
              same class, have arrived or left,&quot; no means were provided by 
              the company to enable employees to secure definite information of 
              that character. That responsible operating officers were well aware 
              of the conditions existing at Shops, as well as the fact that train 
              employees were not strictly adhering to the requirements of the 
              rule, is evidenced by the superintendents bulletin No. 1268, issued 
              last May. It appears that bulletin contemplated orders would be 
              issued and delivered to outbound trains at Shops giving notice of 
              superior trains which had arrived, but no practice of this nature 
              was in effect. The custom of merely notifying outbound train crews 
              of the number of the locomotive hauling an opposing superior train 
              was utterly inadequate as a safeguard, for under the practices followed, 
              the train crew was required to observe and correctly read the number 
              of the passing locomotive under all conditions of weather and traffic.</p>
            <p>The records show that during the month of June, on average of 23 
              trains daily were operated into and from Nashville over this division, 
              and the number of yard movements materially increased the density 
              of traffic between Nashville and Shops.</p>
            <p>Under these circumstances, it is absolutely essential to safety 
              that some means be provided for supplying to outbound crews definite 
              information regarding opposing superior trains, as, for example, 
              by the maintenance of a train register at Shops, or by issuing orders 
              to outbound trains at Shops giving definite notice of the arrival 
              at that point of superior trains which had not arrived at Nashville 
              at the time of departure of the outbound trains.</p>
            <p>This accident would have been prevented, beyond question of doubt, 
              by a properly operated manual block system on the single-track line 
              north of Shops, for which all necessary appliances and facilities 
              were already available. The time table indicates that between Nashville 
              and Hickman, Ky., a distance of approximately 172 miles, there are 
              27 train-order offices, of which 14 are continuously operated. On 
              this line there are 4 schedules passenger train in each direction, 
              and a total of 12 schedules freight trains. With this volume of 
              traffic, and in view of the universally recognized features of increased 
              safety afforded by the block system, there can be no valid excuse 
              for the failure or neglect on the part of the railroad company to 
              utilize existing facilities for the purpose of operating a block 
              system on that line.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted that all the cars of both trains, except the 
              two sleeping cars on train No. 1, were of wooden construction, and 
              six of these wooden cars were entirely destroyed. This accident 
              presents a more appalling record of deaths and injuries than any 
              other accident investigated by the Commission since the ancient-investigation 
              work was begun in 1912. Had steel cars been used in these trains, 
              the toll of human lives taken in this accident would undoubtedly 
              have been very much less.</p>
            <p>All of the employees involved were experienced men, with the exception 
              of the flagman, with good records, and at the time of the accident 
              the crew of train No. 4 had been on duty 52 minutes, and the crew 
              of Train No. 1, 9 hours and 52 minutes.</p>
            <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
            <p>W. P. BORLAND,</p>
