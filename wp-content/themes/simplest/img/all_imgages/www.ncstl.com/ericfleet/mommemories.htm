<p><STRONG>My Mom's Memories of the NC&STL train in Whiteville, Tennessee</strong></font></p>

            <p><em>I have the yellow papers from my mother, <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~fleet/d79.htm#P2">Betty 
              J. (Pepper) Fleet</a> written about her "Memories of the NC&STL 
              train in Whiteville, Tennessee" on November 1, 2005 read:</em></p>
            <p>I was born in the Mt. Moriah Community of Hardeman County, 
              Tennessee in 1940. I lived there with my parents until 1945 when 
              we moved to Whiteville.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.ncstl.com/ericfleet/whiteville.htm">train depot</a> was on Main Street 
              (Highway 64). It was across the railroad from a large hotel on one 
              corner and a private home on the other corner. My best friend lived 
              in that private home so every time I visited her the train came 
              by several times a day. Everything stopped as we couldn’t hear each 
              other speak above the roar and the house and ground actually “shook.”</p> 
              <p>My very first recollection of the train itself was in 1942 or 1943. 
              My father was drafted into the army and I very distinctly remember 
              waiting for the train that he left on. He was not accepted however 
              and I vividly remember once again going to pick him up at the depot. 
              The train engine was a coal burning one and my senses still can 
              almost “feel” the smell of the smoke and hear the sounds “Choo-Choo” 
              “Choo-Choo” and the shrill shriek of the brakes. The engine had 
              a cow catcher on the front and I remember the huge iron bars that 
              seemed to be connected from one wheel to the next. When they all 
              moved somehow it reminded me of a grasshopper. The engineer always 
              waved and blew the whistle when I would wave at him.</p> 
            <p>The tracks seemed to me to go on forever (they were along Highway 
              64 to the West for many miles). About 2 miles outside Whiteville 
              was <a href="http://www.ncstl.com/ericfleet/ina.htm">Ina road</a> and it was there that the train 
              made a stop to pick up passengers or to let them off as they traveled 
              from Memphis. It was at <a href="http://www.ncstl.com/ericfleet/ina.htm">Ina road</a> that all 
              my aunts and uncles came when they visited my grandparents. Although 
              I do not remember the event I heard my parents tell of many experiences 
              of going to pick up these relatives in a wagon – sometimes getting 
              stuck in deep mud.</p> 
            <p>The Depot was quite a busy place as I remember my mind's eye can 
              still see the iron carts loaded with luggage and cotton. It seems 
              to me that the cotton was in small cube sizes probably 4 x 4 feet. 
              Not nearly as large as a bale of cotton. I do not know why they 
              were taken that way but there was a cotton gin next door to my friend's 
              house – and they may have loaded cotton from the gin directly into 
              the box cars. The station was yellow with green trim. A blackboard 
              hung outside on the wall next to a window where sat the station 
              master. I remember watching him send messages with dashes & dots, 
              click-clicking away. Telegrams could also be sent from there. </p>
            <p>I can not recall the man's name that was there during the 40’s 
              but I very well remember the 50’s. That man's name was <a href="http://www.ncstl.com/ericfleet/darnell.htm">Wilburn 
              Darnell</a> (see <a href="images/whitevillecard.jpg">"W. Darnell, 
              Agent" on the lower right corner of the ad card</a>) and he was 
              our next door neighbor.</p> Sometime in the very late 40’s or 50’s 
              I remember the “new” <a href="http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/MemphisUnionStation/NC&StL-535-Memphis5-31-48.jpg">streamliner</a> 
              as we called it. What a sleek, skinny, frightening thing it was. 
              To a young girl it appeared to be something out of the distant future. 
              It was <a href="http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/MemphisUnionStation/NC&StL-535-Memphis5-31-48.jpg">silver 
              and I remember a hugh light on the very nose of the engine</a> – 
              oh yes and I almost forgot. I always wanted to watch every car till 
              the Caboose passed by. I thought cabooses were so strange looking 
              but I surely wished I could ride in one.</p> It was during this 
              period of time that I remember riding the train to Memphis to visit 
              my uncles and aunts. I could not have been more that 11 or 12 the 
              first time I rode the train (my mother had taken me to Kentucky 
              when I was around 4 but I can’t recall that). My mother went with 
              me to the station bought my ticket and instructed me to be sure 
              I didn’t loose it. I then boarded the train all by myself and went 
              to Memphis where I was picked up by an uncle at <a href="http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/Other-Passenger-Stations/Lenox_Station.htm">Lenox 
              station</a>. That was a day and time when it was safe for a young 
              girl to travel alone with no fear of harm. </p>
            <p>I do not actually remember what the inside of the train looked 
              like but I do remember the windows could be lowered or raised and 
              there was a cord that ran along the length of the passenger car. 
              It was the “emergency” cord and I was strongly advised to never 
              touch it. My mother said it might cause the train to have a wreck. 
              Another thing I remember about those rides was the train stopping 
              at a water tank (see far below). To me these tanks seemed gigantic 
              and I could not understand why a train needed to take in water. 
              I remember the conductor punching my ticket, it seems to me, several 
              times during the trips. Always when I arrived at the <a href="http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/Other-Passenger-Stations/Lenox_Station.htm">Lenox 
              station</a> my uncle would be waiting for me. I distinctly remember 
              there being something elevated next to the station. It was like 
              a deck or platform that had some type of sides around it and benches. 
              It also seemed that there was a picnic table there, perhaps I’m 
              wrong about that, but I do remember having to go <a href="http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/MemphisUnionStation/Lenox-3.jpg">down 
              what seemed to me to be a great number of steps</a> to get to my 
              uncle. It seems to me that he may have walked from his home on South 
              Cox Street in Memphis to get me (see <a href="http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/maps/NC&StL-Maps.htm">NC&STL 
              map</a> among Lenox Station & Aulon Tower). I know now that Southern 
              was just about a block from where he lived and the train did travel 
              right along Southern as those tracks are still there today. </p>
            <p>I don’t remember ever boarding the train in Memphis to return to 
              Whiteville. I suppose my father & mother must have come to get me 
              and take me home. During the 50’s most of my relatives traveled 
              by bus as did I so the train wasn’t used by us any more. My last 
              train ride was in 1965. I lived in Sanford, Florida with my husband 
              who was in the U.S. Navy serving in Vietnam. My 2 daughters were 
              8 months & 23 month months old. We come home to Whiteville for a 
              few months stay. How different this trip was from those of my childhood. 
              It was an Amtrak train and I had a small room that had a fold down 
              “bed”. I especially remember the conductor. He was very guff and 
              actually quite rude. We made it home but I vowed never to ride a 
              train again. After that we always flew home or anywhere we needed 
              to go.</p> Little did I know those many years ago that one day I 
              would have a son who would be so interested in trains. If I had 
              known, I would have made a few notes and tried to remember much 
              more.</p> </p>
            <p>Today the Whiteville depot is gone – the tracks are gone, the telephone 
              poles with the bright blue insulations are gone and my aunts and 
              uncles are gone. There are no more smells of burning coal or the 
              lonesome whistle. But I still see trains, and from where I live 
              in Bartlett I occacionally hear the loud blowing of the whistle 
              to warn drives & pedestrians along Stage Road and Raleigh Lagrange 
              Road that it is about to approach.</p> Eric, Since writing the first 
              part of my memories of the train a few other things have come to 
              mind. I remember that inside of the depot was a dull stark room 
              with a few hand-hewn benches. The men smoked cigarette and cigars 
              and they also dipped snuff so there were spittoons in several places. 
              That was the first and only time I ever saw a spittoon and I thought 
              they were so nasty. The room was smokey / hazey I think this may 
              have been the gathering place for the older men to sit and talk.</p> 
            </p>
            <p>Another thing I remembered was once when I was riding the train 
              there was an American Indian dressed in Indian clothes and leather 
              moccasins (shoes). His clothes had beads on them. I was somewhat 
              afraid because they only Indians I had ever seen were at the picture 
              show (That's what the movie was called back then) and they were 
              always fighting. I've tired to remember more about that but I can't 
              - just have in my mind's eye the image of that Indian man. I also 
              remembered that at my friend's house when they old coal burning 
              engine come by the black soot got all over the yard and the porch. 
              Her mother was always sweeping it away. </p>
            <p>Once we heard that if you put a penny on the track that the train 
              would mash it flat. I asked Nanny (my mother) about that and she 
              said she had heard that it would cause a train to have a wreck. 
              Well - I didn't always obey my mother so one day when we heard the 
              train coming we (my friend and I) put the penny on the track. Sure 
              enough the penny was mashed flat and we had a hard time finding 
              it when the train was gone. It didn't cause the train to wreck but 
              we were surely scared that it might. I still have that penny today 
              (see below). I will try to find it for you.</p> </p> </p> </p> </p>
