            <p>Over my life I have lived in six towns in two states and of those 
              six places, I have never lived in a single town, hamlet, or city 
              that was not served by the NC. I see some irony in this fact; the 
              NC&amp;St.L certainly has a vast and firm intertwining with my soul!</p>
            <p>I was born in a small clinic on the town square of McKenzie TN. 
              Less than one hundred yards from the point of my birth ran the right-of-way 
              of the railroad.</p>
            <p>About two years later, we moved from McKenzie to Harding Ky. and 
              again a short distance from our house was the trackage of the NC. 
              I can't say I consciously remember the steam engines that by this 
              time must have had only months of service left before they would 
              be replaces by their new younger brothers, the diesels. There must 
              have still been a few steam engines still trudging the old P &amp; 
              M branch near my home, but I was too young to remember. I have always 
              hated the fact that because the NC. was one of the first railroads 
              in the nation to completely dieselize, I cannot remember seeing 
              steam engines in every day service. [On Sunday January 4th, 1953 
              a steam engine pulling a passenger train on the Bruceton-Union City 
              branch chugged into Union City. This train was the last run of a 
              scheduled steam engine on the entire system and the last run of 
              a passenger train on that branch] </p>
            <p>The wanderlust of my father then transferred us to Memphis. Though 
              my father did not work for the NC., he did work for a railroad. 
              I remember going to his workplace with my mother. My father was 
              a freight car painter for the Illinois Central RR.<br>
              <br>
              Next we moved to Dresden Tn., again an NC&amp;St.L Ry. town. Soon, 
              to my great joy I was now living less than 75 yards from the depot 
              and all the fun that can be had at a place like that. Mr. Sam A. 
              Buts was the stationmaster at the Dresden depot. I can only imagine 
              the hours I must have spent in that old train station talking with 
              Mr. Butts. What patients he must have had in answering over and 
              over the endless stream of question I surely fired at him. I remember 
              him showing me every part of the old station. He showed me how the 
              telegraph worked and how the &quot;order hoop&quot; was used to 
              pass up the train orders to a train crew as it sped by. Mr. Butts 
              even allowed me to stand on his desk and pull the handled cables 
              that controlled the semaphore signal adjacent to the station. </p>
            <p>Dresden was a farming community in the late 1950's. Two of the 
              primary farming commodities for Dresden and Weakley Co.TN. were 
              potatoes and cotton and those were two of the items that never seemed 
              to be in short supply around the depot of my youth. I remember the 
              cotton gin that sat about 1/8 mile north of the depot and directly 
              next to the tracks. Since there was not a rail spur to the gin, 
              all the large cotton bales had to be wrapped at the mill and then 
              transported to the depot platform for loading into boxcars. I spent 
              many hours romping and jumping on top of those mammoth steel banded 
              bundles of cotton.</p>
            <p>Directly across the tracks from the depot was a cinder block building 
              that was used as a sweet potato storage building. My grandfather 
              at one time worked in that building sorting potatoes for shipment 
              by truck and rail. These too were brought across the tracks to the 
              depot for shipment by railcar. </p>
            <p>In my minds eye, I can still see shirtless men working late into 
              the night loading both potatoes and 500 pound cotton bales onto 
              yellow striped, Dixieland boxes. </p>
            <p>To the south of the depot stood a stockyard and next to that was 
              a coal yard replete with a dump pit and conveyor under the track. 
              Just south of the coal yard was the foundation of an old icehouse. 
              During the 1950's the stockyard was still receiving hogs and cattle, 
              the coal yard still did a small amount of business, but the icehouse 
              was long gone. Though all three establishments had had access to 
              the NC&amp;St.L at one time or another, none were by that time doing 
              any shipping or receiving by rail. </p>
            <p>I would hang around the depot even when there was nothing going 
              on there. One of the greatest remembrances of my youth was one Sunday 
              afternoon I was playing on the platform of the station when up pulled 
              one of the 800 series, F units. On this date I could not have been 
              any older than 8 years old. The engineer who was setting out a car 
              or two on the station siding looked down and saw me standing on 
              the platform looking back at him. He must have sensed the fascination 
              in my face because he invited me to ascend the steps to the cab 
              of the engine. For the next few minutes I must have been in heaven. 
              He allowed me to blow the horn and to actually open the throttle 
              on that beautiful blue and gray unit. I had played engineer of my 
              Lionel trains but now I was in control of 1500 hp of real NC&amp;St.L 
              power!</p>
            <p>Although I love the yellow stripes of the 40' boxcars and the Geeps, 
              I must admit that my favorite NC cars are the lowly right of way 
              maintenance cars and their associates the bunk cars. Just before 
              I moved from Dresden in 1960, the State of Tennessee built a new 
              Highway 22 bypass outside of town. The new bypass cut across the 
              path of the NC. trackage and a new bridge had to be constructed 
              to form an overpass. The need for a new bridge caused the railroad 
              to bring to town a work train and crew to build the shoofly track 
              and to construct the new span. The L&amp;N brought to Dresden a 
              dilapidated old work train still lettered in NC. reporting marks; 
              they positioned the train right beside my house. For the entire 
              summer of 1959 I watched the bridge building crew come and go to 
              their home upon the rails. Finally near the onset of fall, the bridge 
              girders themselves arrived on the back of a freight train. I can 
              recall riding my Western Flyer bike out to the construction on several 
              occasions to watch the cranes lift the new spans into place.</p>
            <p>The bridge is gone now, as is the old depot. Mr. Butts died in 
              the early 1960's. The cotton mill, the potato house, the stockyards, 
              the coal yard, the tracks from Dresden to Union City and even the 
              NC&amp;St.L itself has passed into history, but, if I listen close 
              enough, the low rumble of a far off NC. GP-9 setting out a car or 
              two at the Dresden depot late at night, I can still hear in my mind.
