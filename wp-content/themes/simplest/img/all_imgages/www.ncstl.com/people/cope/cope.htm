              Cope, one of the most efficient locomotive engineers in the employ 
              of the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga railroad, and a highly respected 
              citizen of Tracy City was born in Grundy county, May 8, 1861, and 
              is a son of W. M. and Pinney (Sanders) Cope&#8230;</p>
            <p>Only one of his brothers (was) involved in the railway and that 
              was J.P., a railway fireman, who was deceased prior to the writing 
              of these events&#8230;</p>
            <p>When a boy, Matt Cope commenced working on a switch engine as fireman, 
              later was brakeman, but afterward returned to firing, and when the 
              Nashville &amp; Chattanooga railroad bought the Tracy City branch 
              from the Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; Railroad Company, he became 
              an engineer, and is still serving in that capacity, being one of 
              their most faithful and trusted employees&#8230;.</p>
            <p>Fraternally Mr. Cope belongs to the Knights of Pythias, the Royal 
              Arcanum and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.</p>

            <p align="center"><strong>Matt Cope Dead<br>
              Passes Away Peacefully <br>
              Friday Afternoon at 12:50 O&#8217;clock</strong></p>
            <p>Promotion came to him rapidly, however on account of his efficiency 
              and adaptability to the work, and while still little more that a 
              boy, he became an engineer. When the TCI&amp;RR Co. sold out to 
              the NC&amp;StL Ry, Mr. Cope continued in the service and was one 
              of the most trusted and competent men in the employ of that company 
              until the end of his working life, which was on March 14,1916, when, 
              on account of declining health, he (was) forced to leave his position. 
              He was placed on the retired list January 1st, 1917</p>
            <p>During his long tenure of service as an Engineer, Mr. Cope witnessed 
              the passing of many of the old timers of the Tracy City Branch, 
              some of whom died peacefully in their beds, others of whom were 
              killed in the course of duty. Geo. Colyar, who died in 1908, was, 
              for many years his conductor; William Bolton, killed at the Depot 
              platform, March 1, 1877, was a lifelong friend and co-worker with 
              Mr. Cope, as were also James Rust, Ben Finch, Elisha Hardin, Jim 
              Wilson, John Sansom and many other of the older railroad men who 
              have gone before. During his long career as an engineer Mr. Cope 
              had numerous close calls for his life but was never seriously injured 
              and it is a matter of note among the few survivors of the early 
              days that, no matter what the emergency, he always stuck to his 
              cab. And through it all, he was modest and unassuming, kindly and 
              genial and &#8220;on the square&#8221; with everyone and these are 
              some of characteristics, which endeared him to the hearts of all. 
              He will be sadly missed by his family and his friends all along 
              the Tracy City Branch but it is sweet solace to know that he was 
              a Christian, did his life&#8217;s work well and was ready to go.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p>And his soul is mounting higher,<br>
                  To the home where &#8216;twill abide.<br>
                  Like an engine, surely, strongly,<br>

              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In the faraway days of his early experiences, the life of a railroad 
              man on the Tracy City Branch was full of an eminent and ever-present 
              peril. The rails were of iron and easy to break. The engines, small 
              unstable affairs, caricatures of the huge, finely equipped moguls 
              of today, were prone to the eccentric tricks of jumping the track, 
              turning over and any other unexpected thing. Air, as applied to 
              cars, was unknown then and the safety of the trains on the precipitous 
              grades of Cumberland Mountain depended solely upon the use of steam 
              and the hand brakes. The cars of less than half the capacity of 
              those in use now, were coupled together with link and pin. </p>
            <p align="center">* * *</p>
            <p> One dark rainy winter night, a train of coal cars left the Tracy 
              City yard with Mr. Cope in the cab of Engine number 93. The train 
              proceeded to a point beyond Sewanee without mishap, where a wreck 
              occurred. The train was pieced together and the downward journey 
              resumed. The brake rigging had been stripped and the engine was 
              held closely to the train to ease it down the heavy grades. Four 
              brakemen, helpless with broken brakes, were scattered over the train. 
              The conductor, Jim Simpson and fireman, Levi Sitz, were in the cab 
              of the engine with Matt Cope. The descent was being made smoothly 
              it seemed, when some member off the crew discovered the head car 
              of the train was about three car lengths from the engine. Matt Cope 
              tried to regain his position against the train and the engine received 
              a jolt, which loosened everything that was not already loose. The 
              engineer realized then that their only hope was to beat the train 
              down the mountain. He put on all steam. Rushing, roaring behind 
              him was that mass of iron and wood and coal. There was certain death 
              behind, if overtaken, and ahead of him there was &#8211; he knew 
              not what. But it was a chance and he took it. There were moments 
              when he could have slowed for an instant and jumped to safety but 
              jumping was the one thing, probably, of which he did not think. 
              There were lives in his hands and company property so he gripped 
              the throttle and stuck. The engine reached the valley and the flat 
              tract a little in advance of the pursuing train&#8230; There might 
              have been some luck mixed in with the adventure; certainly there 
              was a large element of nerve, and maybe a Being greater than all 
              was watching the race from out of the darkness above. In any event, 
              several old-timers in Cowan recollect that the little old &#8220;No 
              93&#8221; went through that station, chased by its own train, at 
              a rate of speed never dared by No&#8217;s 98 or 99. Mr. Cope did 
              not stop at the depot, as was customary. He did not even hesitate. 
              But at a point a mile or so beyond, out on the main line toward 
              Decherd, he stopped, backed up on the now-mollified train and pushed 
              it into Cowan. This instance is only typical of the many such escapes 
              experienced and lived through by Mr. Cope.</p>

            <p><strong>Funeral Service for Mr. Matt Cope, Retired Engineer for 
              the NC&amp;StL Railway </strong></p>
            <p>Mr. Cope, age 55, a veteran engineer of the NC&amp;StL Railway 
              died at his home in Tracy City, Friday afternoon March 9, 1917, 
              at 12:50 o&#8217;clock surrounded by the members of his immediate 
              family. His death came after a lingering illness of many months 
              and was from a complication of diseases involving stomach and intestines.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cope was a member of the Episcopal Church and the funeral ceremony 
              was conducted by Rev. Boyd, rector of the Tracy City Episcopal Church. 
              The brief and impressive burial service of that church was said 
              at home and at the gave Sunday afternoon. The floral offerings were 
              profuse and splendid. Beautiful wreathes of all-white flowers literally 
              covered the grave. These were given by railroad men, the loges of 
              which he was a member, and friends. A design from the Brotherhood 
              of Railroaders, bore the initials &#8220;B. L. E.&#8221; in gold. 
            </p>
            <p>The deceased was an honored member of various lodges. He belonged 
              to the B. L. E., R. A., I.O.O.F. and K. of P.</p>
            <p>A Special train was run up form Cowan Sunday in his honor, and 
              it was crowded to its full capacity. The active pall bearers at 
              the funeral were six locomotive engineers. They were: Messers I. 
              J. and S. O. Kinningham and J. A. Porter (retired) of Cowan, and 
              Messers T. J. Crick, G. B. Marler and W. H. Eller, of Tracy City. 
              Those honorary were selected from different lodges of which he was 
              a member. They were: Messers Louie Hassler, Henry Schild, T. B. 
              Roddy, Ed Roberson, Dallas Hargis and Thos. Weaver.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cope is survived by his widow, Mrs. Mollie Heffner Cope, and 
              two daughters, Miss Wilcie of Tracy City, and Mrs. Murray Bradley 
              of Brewton, Ala; a grandson, Raymond Bobo, and Brother, Amos, of 
              Tracy City and brother Harris Cope of Sequatchie Valley.</p>
            <p>A floral offering in the form of an engine driving wheel, emblematic 
              of his trade, and tendered by the Nashville Brotherhood of Locomotive 
              Engineers, was withheld on account of a flow in the design, a spoke 
              being broken. This was to be placed upon the grave at a later date.</p>
