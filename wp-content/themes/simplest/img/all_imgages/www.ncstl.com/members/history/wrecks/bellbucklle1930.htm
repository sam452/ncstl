              REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST.
              LOUIS RAILWAY AT BELL BUCKLE, TENN., ON APRIL 26, 1930.<br>
              <br>
              May 14, 1930.<br>
              <br>
              To the Commission:<br>
              <br>
              On April 26, 1930, there was a derailment of a freight train on
              the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway at Bell Buckle,
              Tenn., which resulted in the death of two trespassers.<br>
              <br>
              Location arid method of operation<br>
              <br>
              This accident occurred on the Chattanooga Division, which extends
              between Chattanooga and Nashville, Tenn., a distance of 151.7 miles,
              and is a single-track line over which trains are operated by time-table,
              train orders, arid an automatic block-signal system. The accident
              occurred at the north switch of the house track at Bell Buckle;
              this track parallels the main track on the west, and the north
              switch is located 908 feet north of the station. Approaching this
              point from the north, the track is tangent for a distance of approximately
              3 miles to the point of accident, and for some distance beyond
              that point. The grade at the point of accident is 0.18 per cent
              descending for southbound trains.<br>
              <br>
              The track is laid with 90-pound rails, 33 feet in length, with
              an average of 18 ties to the rail-length, fully tie-plated, single-spiked,
              and is equipped with anti-rail creepers; it is ballasted with limestone
              to a depth of about 24 inches. The track is well maintained.<br>
              <br>
              The weather was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred
              about 1.15 p.m.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Description</strong><br>
              <br>
              Southbound freight train No. 41 consisted of 48 cars and a caboose,
              hauled by engine 569, and was in charge of Conductor Riggles and
              Engineman McCollum. This train passed Murfreesboro, 19.03 miles
              north of Bell Buckle, at 12.34 p.m., 9 hours and 15 minutes late,
              and was derailed at Bell Buckle while traveling at an estimated
              speed of about 25 miles per hour.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><a href="#diagram">Diagram</a></strong><br>
              <br>
              Inv. No. 1633 Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Ry. Bell Buckle,
              Tenn. April 26, 1930<br>
              <br>
              The thirteenth to the twenty-fourth cars, inclusive, were derailed.
              At the time of the accident, there were three cars standing on
              the house track near its northern end, and the thirteenth car in
              the train collided with these cars, destroying one of them. The
              fourteenth oar, with its rear truck derailed, came to a stop 300
              feet south of the initial point of derailment, while the remaining
              derailed cars came to rest in various positions, with some of them
              overturned, and seven of them badly damaged.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Summary of evidence</strong><br>
              <br>
              Engineman McCollum stated that before leaving Nashville, an air-brake
              test was made, after which the inspector reported that the brakes
              were in proper working order. There was nothing unusual about the
              movement of the train until it reached the north house-track switch
              at Bell Buckle. While approaching this point, he reduced speed
              from 38 or 40 miles per hour to about 20 miles per hour, and approximately
              one minute after he had released the brakes they applied in emergency;
              he immediately placed the brake-valve handle in lap position and
              closed the throttle, and as soon as the train came to a stop, he
              looked back and noticed the derailed equipment. He then went back
              to the scene of accident, but did not examine the track or cars
              to ascertain thc cause of the accident. Fireman Burns concurred
              in the statements made by Engineman McCollum<br>
              <br>
              Conductor Riggles stated that he rode on the engine from Nashville
              to Lavergne, but from the latter point he rode in the cupola of
              the caboose. The brakes were applied approaching Bell Buckle, reducing
              the speed from 40 miles per hour to about 25 miles per hour; they
              were then released and about one-half minute afterwards he felt
              them apply in emergency and upon looking ahead he saw the cars
              derailing. He examined the track in the vicinity of the point of
              derailment and found marks on the rails and ties, 4 or 5 feet north
              of the north house-track switch, which appeared to have been caused
              by something dragging, and a truck under what had been the 13th
              car in the train, W.C.L. tank car 1072, was badly damaged. These
              conditions caused him to form the opinion that this truck failed
              just before reaching the switch, and that the car was derailed
              when it encountered the switch.<br>
              <br>
              Head Brakeman Stovall stated that when the train stopped at Lavergne,
              35 miles from Bell Buckle, he went back along the enginemans side
              of the train about 12 car-lengths, crossed over to the firemans
              side and returned to the engine; he did not think that he went
              back as far as the rear end of the 13th car. After the accident
              he went back and noticed what had occurred, but made no examination
              to determine the cause of the accident,<br>
              <br>
              Flagman Jordan agreed with the statements of the conductor as to
              what transpired up to the time of the accident. He immediately
              went back to flag for a distance of approximately 1 mile, and on
              his way he looked for marks on the track but did not discover anything
              to indicate that something had been dragging. When he returned
              to the point of accident, he noticed a flange mark on a tie on
              the east side of the track about 3 feet from the heel of the switch
              point; he made no further inspection of the equipment or track.<br>
              <br>
              Car Inspector Brown stated that he inspected the west side of the
              train which brought W.C.L. tank car 1072 into Nashville, at 7 a.m.,
              and also inspected the west side of train No. 41 when it departed
              on the trip in which the accident occurred, but took no exception
              to W.C.L. 1072. He said these inspections were Class 1 inspections,
              which consisted of looking at all bolts, nuts, arch bars, and other
              truck equipment, and he was positive that the nuts on the oil box
              bolts were in place and tight on this car at the time he inspected
              it.<br>
              <br>
              Wreck Foreman Whitaker stated that when he arrived at the scene
              of accident, all of the cars which remained on the track had been
              removed. While clearing away the wreckage he found a truck under
              W.C.L. 1072 in a collapsed condition, with the box bolts and the
              oil box missing, This truck was then under the north end of the
              car, but from the position in which the car was lying and the nature
              of the accident, it was his opinion that the car had been reversed
              after having been derailed, and that the broken truck was the leading
              truck in the direction in which the car was moving in the train,
              also that a wheel which was loosened from the box, due to the missing
              box bolts, had been the leading wheel on the west side of this
              track; this pair of wheels was detached from the truck frame. He
              inspected the track and noticed marks on the outside of the ball
              of the west rail, two or three rail-lengths north of the initial
              point of derailment, which indicated that something had been dragging.
              In his opinion, there was nothing about track conditions that contributed
              to the accident, saying that it was caused by the arch bar on this
              truck dropping down on account of the missing bolts.<br>
              <br>
              Track Supervisor Mahoney stated that he arrived at the point of
              accident at 4.15 p.m., and made an investigation to determine its
              cause, He noticed that something had caught on the stock rail on
              the west side of the track, l2 1/2 feet from the point of switch;
              this mark was about 3/4 inch below the top, and on the outside,
              of the ball of the rail. From this point to a point about 10 feet
              farther south, the stock rail was canted inward about 1 inch. At
              a point 26 1/2 feet from the point of switch, there was a mark
              on top of the stock rail which ran diagonally across the rail for
              a distance of 12 1/2 feet, and from this point southward there
              were well-defined wheel marks on the ties. An inspection of the
              switch disclosed that it was in good condition, with the exception
              of some parts that were damaged as a result of the derailment.
              Measurements taken of the elevation at the point of accident showed
              that it was 1/4 inch low on the east side, and for a distance of
              300 feet northward from the switch there was only a slight variation
              either in gauge or surface. Mr. Mahoneys further examination of
              the track showed that there were marks on the outside and a little
              below the running surface of the west rail which indicated that
              something had been dragging; these marks extended northward for
              a distance of 6 3/4 miles. At the south house-track switch at Forestville,
              a trailing-point switch located about 5 1/4 miles north of the
              point of accident, there were marks on the east side of the stock
              rail which showed that something had climbed over it at a point
              12 1/2 feet north of the switch point. At the north switch of this
              same track at Forestville, which is a facing-point turnout to the
              right, the same marks were found on the outside of the west rail,
              indicating that something had cleared the stock rail. While the
              derailed equipment was being removed, he saw the broken truck under
              W.C.L. tank car 1072, with bolts and an oil box missing. It appeared
              that the position of the car had been reversed in the wreck, as
              from the marking on the track it was apparent that the broken part
              of the truck had been on the west side of the track. He considered
              that the track was in good condition, and was certain that it did
              not cause or contribute in any way to the occurrence of the accident,<br>
              <br>
              An inspection made by the Commissions inspectors disclosed that
              the marks on the track were practically the same as those described
              by Supervisor Mahoney. The first mark on the east side of the track
              was a flange mark on a tie, 30 feet 4 inches south of the switch
              point and 9 inches from the gauge side of the rail. The marks on
              the outside of the ball of the west rail were not continuous and
              at different points they were several feet apart. They showed signs
              of something having rubbed lightly against the rail, except at
              the switch, where heavy indentations were made. The truck in question
              was the leading truck under W.C.L. 1072 and was of the arch-bar
              type. The dimensions of the arch bar were 1 3/8 x 4 1/2 inches,
              the tie bar was 5/8 x 4 1/2 inches, and the top bar was 1 1/2 x
              4 1/2 inches, with bolts 1 1/8 inches in diameter. The right front
              oil box and bolts were missing and the wheel was detached. The
              bottom of the tie bar and the inside edges of both bars showed
              longitudinal abrasions and also burned slivers of metal. The three
              bars on this side were bent upward and backward, but were not broken.
              There were two heavy vertical abrasions on the upturned portion
              of the bottom tie bar and the bolt holes were elongated, measuring
              1 9/16 inches. On this truck, and also on the other truck under
              this car, the nuts were secured on the box bolts, but the bolts
              were not tight, and the nuts rotating with the bolts had countersunk
              in the bottom of the tie bars to about one-half their thickness;
              however, this condition did not appear on the bar where the bolts
              were missing. In some instances the box bolt holes in the bottom
              tie bars were elongated to the extent that they could be seen at
              the outside edges of the nuts. The brake beams remained intact,
              except the end of the beam where the oil box was missing; here
              the shoe was missing, and a part of the brake head broken.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
              <br>
              This accident apparently was caused by the failure of an arch-bar
              truck under the 13th car in the train.<br>
              <br>
              According to the evidence, the members of the crew had no knowledge
              of anything wrong until the train was derailed. An inspection of
              the track disclosed that something had been dragging which had
              scored the outside surface of the ball of the west rail at intervals
              for a distance of 6 3/4 miles. An examination of the forward truck
              of W.C.L. tank oar 1072, which was loaded with oil, showed that
              there were abrasions on the bottom of the tie bar and the inside
              edges of both the tic bar and arch bar on the west side of the
              leading pair of wheels, and the metal was slivered and burned,
              while the oil box and box bolts were missing. One of these bolts
              was found while clearing the wreckage and on it was a nut, secured
              by corrosion, but the bolt had been sheared off 1 3/4 inches from
              the top. Oar Inspector Brown stated that he closely inspected the
              west side of the train that handled this car into Nashville, and
              was certain that there were nuts on all of the oil-box bolts and
              they were firmly seated. From all of the evidence, however, it
              would appear that the west side of this truck, at its forward end,
              became defective in some manner which permitted the arch bar to
              drop down, and when it encountered the stock rail at the north
              house-track switch it caused the truck to derail, resulting in
              the final derailment of the train.<br>
              <br>
              The employees involved were experienced men and at the time of
              the accident none of them had been on duty in violation of any
              of the provisions of the hours of service law.<br>
              <br>
