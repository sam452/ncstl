            <p>              REPORT OF THE COMMISSION 1<br>
              PATTERSON, Commissioner:</p>
            <p>On October 14, 1942, there was a head-end collision between two
              freight trains on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway
              near Somerville, Tenn., which resulted in the death of one employee
              and
              the injury of six employees.</p>
            <p>              <a href="#diagram">Diagram </a></p>
            <p>Inv-2634 Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway Somerville,
              Tenn. October 14, 1942<br>
              Location of Accident and Method of Operation</p>
            <p>              This accident occurred on that part of the Paducah and Memphis
              Division extending between Bruceton and Memphis, Tenn., a distance
              of 143.37
              miles. In the vicinity of the point of accident this is a single-track
              line over which trains are operated by timetable and train orders.
              There is no block system in use. The accident occurred at a point
              2.87 miles south of the station at Somerville. Approaching from
              the north there are, in succession, a tangent 7,105 feet in length,
              a
              10 curve to the left 1,362 feet, and a tangent 1,672 feet to the
              point of accident and 685 feet beyond. Approaching from the south
              there are, in succession, a tangent 1,154 feet in length, a 2 degrees
              curve to the left 1,371 feet, and the tangent on which the accident
              occurred. The grade for south-bound trains is 1.01 percent descending
              a distance of 1,300 feet to the point of accident. The grade for
              north-bound trains is, successively, 0.67 percent ascending 300
              feet, 1.17 percent ascending 800 feet, and 1.01 percent ascending
              400 feet
              to the point of accident.</p>
            <p>              Operating rules read in part as follows:<br>
              87. Inferior trains must keep out of the way of superior trains
              in the opposite direction, clearing their time as required by rule,
              * * *.<br>
              93. Certain yards will be indicated by yard or station limit signs.
              Within such limits the main track may be used, protecting against
              first and second class trains. Third class and extra trains must
              move on the main track under such control that they can stop within
              range of their vision.</p>
            <p>              FORMS OF TRAIN ORDERS<br>
              EXAMPLES<br>
              (1.) No 2 has right over No 1 H to D.<br>
              This form of order makes the train over which right is given inferior
              to the train which is given right over it, between the points named,
              * * *<br>
              If the trains meet at the first or last named points, the train

            <p><strong>              Description of Accident</strong><br>
              At Whiteville, 12.94 miles north of Somerville, First 150, a south-bound
              third-class freight train, consisted of engine 605, 30 cars and
              a caboose. At this point the crew received a clearance, Form A,
              and
              copies of two train orders, of which one was train order No. 241,
              Form 19, reading as follows:</p>
            <p>              First No 150 Eng 605 has right over Fourth No 155 Eng 500 Whiteville
              to Somerville</p>
            <p>              First 150 departed from Whiteville at 6:52 a.m., according to the
              dispatcher's record of movement of trains, 3 hours 6 minutes late,
              departed from Somerville, the last open office, at 7:24 a.m., 3
              hours 9 minutes late, and while moving at an estimated speed of
              25 miles
              per hour it collided with Fourth 155 at a point 2.87 miles south
              of the station at Somerville.</p>
            <p>              Fourth 155, a north-bound third-class freight train, consisted
              of engines 500 and 621, coupled, 48 cars and a caboose, in the
              order
              named. At Memphis, 43.06 miles south of Somerville, a terminal
              air-brake test was made and the brakes functioned properly. This
              train departed
              from Memphis at 4:10 a.m. according to the dispatcher's record
              of movement of trains, 7 hours 50 minutes late, departed from Aulon,
              37.79 miles south of Somerville and the last open office, at 5:55
              a.m., a hours 54 minutes late, and while moving at an estimated
              speed
              of 30 miles per hour it collided with First 150.</p>
            <p>              The brakes of both trains had functioned properly at all points
              where used en route. There was no condition of the engines of either
              train
              that obscured the vision or distracted the attention of the employees
              who were on the engines. From an engine moving in either direction,
              in the vicinity of the point of accident, the view of a train approaching
              from the opposite direction is restricted to a distance of about
              800 feet, because of vegetation on the east side of the track and
              track curvature.</p>
            <p>              The force of the impact demolished engines 605 and 500. The running
              gear of engine 605 stopped on the roadbed about 5 feet north of
              the point of accident, and the boiler stopped upright across the
              track
              and about 7 feet north of the running gear. The tender stopped
              across the track and about 55 feet north of the point of accident.
              The first
              3 cars of First 150 were destroyed. The front truck of the fourth
              car was derailed. The running gear of engine 500 stopped about
              15 feet west of the track and opposite the running gear of engine
              605.
              The boiler of engine 500 stopped bottom up and against the running
              gear. The tender stopped between the track and the running gear.
              Engine 621 was derailed to the west and stopped, badly damaged,
              on its left side, parallel to the track and with its front end
              about
              10 feet north of the point of accident. The tender was derailed
              to the east and stopped at an angle of about 45 degrees to the
              track.
              The first 14 cars of Fourth 155 were destroyed. The front truck
              of the fifteenth car was derailed. The wreckage of both trains
              was contained
              within a distance of 205 feet.</p>
            <p>              It was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred about
              7:30 a. m.</p>
            <p>              The employee killed was the front brakeman of First 150. The employees
              injured were the conductor and the engineer of First 150 and both
              engineers and both firemen of Fourth 155.</p>
            <p><strong>              Data</strong><br>
              During the 30-day period preceding the day of the accident, the
              average daily movement in the vicinity of the point of accident
              was 20.5
              trains.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Discussion</strong><br>
              The rules governing operation on the line involved provide that
              an inferior train must keep out of the way of opposing superior
              trains.
              Unless otherwise provided, a train which has been given right over
              an opposing superior train must take siding at the point to which
              right is given unless the train over which right is given has been
              met at an intermediate point. Within yard limits the main track
              may be used protecting against first and second-class trains. Third-class
              and extra trains must be operated prepared to stop unless the way
              is seen or known to be clear. All surviving employees involved
              understood
              these requirements.</p>
            <p>              The trains involved were third-class trains. Fourth 155 was superior
              to First 150 by direction. Under the provisions of order No. 241
              which was issued to First 150 at Whiteville and to Fourth 155 at
              Somerville, First 150 was given right over Fourth 155 from Whiteville
              to Somerville. At Somerville, yard- limit signs are located 5,233
              feet north and 6,221 feet south of the station and there are two
              sidings within the yard limits. Since there was no overdue first-class
              schedule and no second-class schedules in effect, under the yard-limit
              rule First 150 was authorized to occupy the main track at Somerville,
              but was not authorized to proceed south of the south yard-limit
              sign unless Fourth 155 had been met. First 150 departed from Somerville
              and had proceeded a distance of 1.69 miles south of the south yard-limit
              sign when it collided with Fourth 155.</p>
            <p>              As Fourth 155 was approaching the point where the accident occurred,
              the speed was about 35 miles per hour, and the engine-men of both
              engines and the front brakeman, who was on the first engine, were
              maintaining a lookout ahead. The view of the track ahead was restricted
              because of track curvature and vegetation. The first the engineer
              of engine 500 knew of the opposing train was when his engine reached
              a point about 800 feet south of the point where the accident occurred
              and he observed the reflection of the headlight of First 150. He
              immediately moved the brake valve to emergency position. The speed
              of Fourth 155 was about 30 miles per hour at the time of the collision.</p>
            <p>              As First 150 was approaching the point where the accident occurred,
              the speed was about 30 miles per hour. The enginemen, the conductor
              and the front brakeman, who were maintaining a lookout ahead from
              the engine, and the flagman, who was on the caboose, knew that
              their train was inferior to Fourth 155 and that no train orders
              had been
              issued authorizing their train to proceed on the time of Fourth
              155 beyond the south yard-limit sign at Somerville. They said that
              after
              their train stopped at Somerville to take coal and water they forgot
              about Fourth 155. The engineer saw Fourth 155 approaching at a
              distance of about 800 feet and he moved the brake valve to emergency
              position.
              The speed of First 150 was about 25 miles per hour at the time
              of collision</p>
            <p>              In the territory involved trains are operated by timetable and
              train orders only. If an adequate block system had been in use
              in this
              territory, this accident would have been averted.</p>
            <p><strong>              Cause</strong><br>
              It is found that this accident was caused by an inferior train
              occupying the main track on the time of an opposing superior train.</p>
            <p><strong>              Recommendation</strong><br>
              It is recommended that the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis
              Railway Company establish an adequate block system on the line
              involved in this accident.</p>
            <p>              Dated at Washington, D. C., this seventh day of December, 1942.<br>
              By the Commission, Commissioner Patterson.<br>
              (SEAL) W. P. BARTEL,<br>
              Secretary.</p>
            <p>              FOOTNOTE<br>
              1 Under authority of section 17 (2) of the Interstate Commerce
                  Act the above-entitled proceeding was referred by the Commission
                  to Commissioner
                  Patterson for consideration and disposition. </p>
