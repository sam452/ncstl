              REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST.
              LOUIS RAILWAY AT CITICO JUNCTION TENN., ON JULY 14, 1924.<br>
              <br>
              August 25, 1924.<br>
              <br>
              To the Commission:<br>
              <br>
              On July 14, 1924, there was a derailment of a freight train on
              the Nashville, Chattanooga. &amp; St. Louis Railway at Citico Junction,
              Tenn., which resulted in the death of one employee.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Location and method of operation</strong><br>
              <br>
              This accident occurred on that part of the Atlanta Division extending
              between Atlanta, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance of 136.8
              miles, Hills Park and Craven Yard being the southern and northern
              termini for freight trains, respectively. In the vicinity of the
              point of accident, which occurred about 2/12, miles south of Chattanooga,
              this is a single-track line over which trains are operated by time-table
              and train or orders, no block-signal system being in use. Approaching
              this point from the south the track is tangent for about 3 miles
              while the grade is practically level. The track is laid with 20-pound
              rails with about 20 ties to the rail length; tie plates and four
              rail anchors to each rail are used. The track is ballasted with
              crushed stone and is well maintained. The weather was clear at
              the time of the accident which occurred about 12.35 a.m.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Description</strong><br>
              <br>
              Northbound third-class freight train No. 52 consisted of 55 cars
              and a caboose hauled by engine 629 and was in charge of Conductor
              Townsend and Engineman Price. This train left Hills Park at 5.30
              p.m., and after having proceeded about 132 miles the train was
              brought to a stop at Boyce by means of the conductors emergency
              valve when fire was discovered flying from the wheels of a car
              about the middle of the train. After an inspection of the car had,
              been made the train started and had proceeded about l mile when
              while running at a speed of about 20 miles an hour the 26th car
              in the train was derailed on account of a broken wheel and causing
              the derailment of nine care immediately following it.<br>
              <br>
              Eight of the ten cars which were derailed were overturned, two
              of which were demolished. The employee killed was the conductor.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Summary of evidence</strong><br>
              <br>
              The first mark of derailment was a light mark across the top of
              the west rail; this was followed by similar marks which became
              deeper. About 200 feet beyond the first mark, flange marks appeared
              on the ties between the rails together with light marks on the
              ends of the ties on the west side of the track which marks, together
              with scored and broken ties and disturbed ballast, continued for
              nearly a mile until the general derailment occurred.<br>
              <br>
              The car involved, Central of Georgia 7055, of the steel underframe
              type, was built in September 1913 and was last repaired on July
              5, 1934, at the Savannah shops of the Central of Georgia Railway.
              The car was equipped with Scullen pedestal type trucks, the truck
              at the &quot;B&quot; end bearing the inscription &quot;A S F Co
              G&quot;. An inspection of the car disclosed flange marks on the
              side and center sills on the east side of the car and the side
              sill on the west side was bent outward and at the &quot;B&quot; end
              caused apparently by the truck wheals coming in contact with the
              car body prior to the general derailment. The broken heel, a 33-inch
              east-iron wheel, No. 978, weight 700-pounds, was made by the Ramapo
              Foundry &amp; Wheels Works on September 12, 1922, for the Central
              of Georgia Railway, and was the leading wheel of the forward truck
              on the firemans side at the &quot;B&quot; end of the car. Inspection
              disclosed that a sector comprising approximately one-fourth of
              its area was broken out of the wheel. No flat spots on shell outs
              were discernible on the wheel and the appearance of the cast iron
              was good. Incipient heat cracks were present in the fragments which
              were detached from the rim of the wheel and all appeared of recent
              formation and probably occurred on the run when the wheel was broken.
              The brake shoe which fitted the broken wheel and unquestionably
              was the one which belonged to the broken wheel showed a rough surface
              indicating it had been sticking. The mate wheel which was also
              made by the Ramapo Iron Works was in good order.<br>
              <br>
              Flagman King said he did not know whether or not an air brake test
              of the train had been made before leaving Hills Park but as the
              air was on in the caboose he assumed that proper inspection and
              test of the air brakes had been made. He said be rode in the caboose
              and when the train stopped at Vinings he made an inspection of
              the rear portion of the train and found nothing wrong. Approaching
              Boyce he was riding on the right side of the caboose and in passing
              the engine of a train standing on a siding at that point he heard
              a warning shout and upon looking out he saw fire flying from the
              wheels of a car about the middle of the train and reported it to
              the conductor who opened the emergency valve bringing the train
              to a stop. Flagman King also said the conductor directed him to
              go back with his flagging equipment and protect against a following
              passenger train. The conductor then went up along the right side
              of the train and Flagman King said he had gone back about 25 car
              lengths when he heard a whistle signal recalling him and started
              back towards the train but saw a proceed signal given and concluded
              that the conductor intended that he should remain out and protect
              the train and he did not learn of the accident until later.<br>
              <br>
              Brakeman Robinson said he rode on the engine leaving Hills Park
              and when a stop was made at Vinings he went back along the train
              making an inspection until he met the rear brakeman and then crossed
              over the train and returned to the engine, finding nothing wrong.
              A stop was made at Rogers coaling station and he again went back
              along the train making an inspection and met the conductor who
              reported a hot journal about 35 cars from the engine which Brakeman
              Robinson treated but said he did not detect any brakes sticking
              or hot boxes on any of the other cars and expressed the opinion
              that had there been a brake sticking on any of the cars he would
              have discovered it. He also said he inspected the, rain at Adairsville
              and at Tilton but detected nothing wrong. A short stop was made
              at Dalton and the train did not again stop until the air brakes
              were applied from the rear end of the train at Boyce when he again
              went back along the train until he met the conductor who told him
              that a rake was sticking or the 26th car and remarked that he was
              sorry that they had stopped for it would not have caused any trouble
              before they got in. Upon making an inspection of the car he found
              a brake shoe bearing on the rear wheel of the forward truck of
              the car on the enginemans side of the train which was red but not
              excessively hot; he said he did not cross to the opposite side
              to inspect the wheels on that side. The conductor blod the air
              off the car but Brakeman Robinson did not know whether or not he
              cut out the air brake. Shortly afterwards the conductor gave a
              proceed signal and they both boarded the car on which the brake
              had been sticking and rode on top, the train proceeding without
              waiting for the flagman to come in, and were riding in this position
              when the forward end of the car was derailed after having proceeded
              about 1 mile and, it which time he estimated the speed to have
              been about 20 miles an hour. Both started giving stop signals and
              ran back to the car immediately following. Brakeman Robinson said
              he descended the side ladder on the car and closed an angle cock
              and upon hearing the brakes applying then crossed over the car
              and was descending the side ladder when the general derailment
              occurred.<br>
              <br>
              Special Patrolman Orr said he boarded the train at Hills Park and
              for the greater portion of the trip he rode on top of the train
              and had occasion to go around the train during the several stops
              that were made en route but noted nothing unusual. Approaching
              Boyce he was riding in the cupola of the caboose and when the stop
              was made at that point he followed the conductor forward along
              the right side of 'the train and when the train started a few minutes
              later he boarded the train and rode on top and was in this position
              when the accident occurred. Patrolman Orr said he did not at any
              time detect the odor of hot wheels or journals.<br>
              <br>
              Engineman Price and Fireman Webb said their first intimation of
              the accident was when the brakes were applied in emergency at the
              time of the derailment while running at a speed of about 20 miles
              an hour. Both said they had looked back along the train frequently
              but had noticed nothing unusual in the operation of the train nor
              had they detected any fire flying. Engineman Price said the air
              brakes were tested at Hills Park and the car inspector reported
              all brakes working properly. At Graysville, 12 miles south of the
              point of accident, he made two applications of the air brakes which
              seemed to work properly, no trouble being experienced with the
              air brakes en route and proper air pressure was maintained at all
              times.<br>
              <br>
              Wrecking Foreman Walker said he arrived at the scene of the derailment
              about two hours after its occurrence and after the main track had
              been cleared which was about four, hours after the accident he
              made an inspection to determine the cause of the accident and found
              the leading truck wheel on the firemans side broken on Central
              of Georgia car 7055. He said the wheel was still hot and expressed
              the opinion that the brake had been sticking for bone time, causing
              the brake shoe to come in contact with the wheel until it became
              hot and broke. He also said the wheel bore no evidence of defects
              or flat spots.<br>
              <br>
              Subsequent to the accident the triple valve on this car which is
              of the K-2 type was tested at Cravens shop and found to be in good
              condition. With the exception of a worn packing leather the air
              brake equipment was also found to be in good condition. General
              Car Foreman Harris said the air brake auxiliary reservoir bore
              stencil marks indicating it had been cleaned at the Central of
              Georgia shop at Savannah on July 5, 1924. He further said that
              upon inspecting the car he found the branch pipe and angle cock
              had been destroyed and he was unable to determine whether or not
              the air brakes were cut out before the accident. He attributed
              the of the wheel breaking to excessive heat due to a brake sticking.<br>
              <br>
              Foreman McCoy said the car in question was on the repair track
              at Hills Park on the day prior to the accident, having been shopped
              for slid flat wheels on the R. &amp; L 3 wheels and with Car Inspector
              Daniel he gauged the wheels an finding the wheels within the condemning
              limit and as no other flat spots were found on the remaining wheels
              he passed the car as satisfactory. Car inspector Daniel and General
              Foreman Carman said they were present when the repair track air
              test was made and at that time the brakes worked properly and showed
              no indication of sticking. Car Inspector Clements said he made
              the air brake test on train No. 52 before its departure from Hills
              Park at which time the brakes applied and released promptly, showing
              no indication of a defective triple valve. Air Brake Machinist
              Bell said he inspected the air brake appurtenances on engine 659
              after the accident and found them to be in good condition.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
              <br>
              This accident was caused by a broken wheel due to excessive heating
              which resulted from the air brakes sticking.<br>
              <br>
              The investigation disclosed that inspections of this train were
              made at several points en route and that the brakes on the derailed
              car were not found sticking until the last stop prior to the derailment;
              at that time the brakes on this car were sticking and it was noted
              the wheels were hot, particularly the right rear wheel of the leading
              truck. According to the brakemans statement, however, no inspection
              was made of the wheels on the opposite side of the car, one of
              which afterwards broke; had such an inspection been made the condition
              which resulted in the derailment might have been discovered in
              time to have prevented the accident.<br>
              <br>
              At the time of the accident none of the members of the crew had
              been on duty in violation of any of the provisions of the hours
              of service law.<br>
              <br>
              Respectfully submitted,<br>
