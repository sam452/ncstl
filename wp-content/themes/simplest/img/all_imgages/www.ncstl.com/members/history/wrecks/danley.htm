            <p align="center">Report No. 3618 Nashville, Chattanooga, St. Louis Railway Danley,
              Tenn. April 15, 1955</p>
            <p><strong>Location or Accident and Method of Operation</strong></p>
            <p>This accident occurred on that part of the Chattanooga Division
              extending between Chattanooga and Nashville, Tenn., 151.59 miles.
              In the vicinity of the point of accident this single-track line,
              over which trains are operated by signal indication. At Danley,
              144.36 miles north of Chattanooga, a siding 4,267 feet in length
              parallels the main track on the east. The accident occurred on
              the main track at a point 674 feet north of the south siding-switch
              at Danley. From the south there is a tangent 1.11 miles in length
              and a 2 degree curve to the left 625 feet to the point of accident
              and 1,076 feet northward. The grade is 1.00 percent ascending northward
              at the point of accident.</p>
            <p>In the vicinity of the point of accident the structure of the
              main track consists or 132-pound nil, 39 feet in length, laid new
              in 1950 on an average of 22 treated ties to the rail length. It
              is fully tieplated with double-shoulder canted tieplates and is
              spiked with two rail-bounds spikes and two plate-holding spikes
              per tieplate. It is provided with 6-hole 36-inch joint bars and
              an average of 12 rail anchors per rail. It is ballasted with crushed
              limestone to a depth of 12 inches below the bottoms of the ties.
              At the point of accident the specified superelevation is 3-1/2
              inches.</p>
            <p>Semi-automatic signal 226RA, governing north-bound movements on
              the main track, is located 1.15 miles south of the point of accident.
              This signal is of the color-light type and forms part of a traffic-control
              system which extends between Stevenson, 38.52 miles north of Chattanonga,
              and a point 1.90 miles south of Nashville. Electric switch locking
              is provided at the siding switches at Danley.</p>
            <p>In the vicinity of the point of accident the maximum authorized
              speed for passenger trains is 50 miles per hour.</p>
            <p><strong>Description of Accident</strong></p>
            <p>No. 94, a north-bound first-class passenger train, consisted of
              Diesel-electric units 806 and 911, coupled in multiple-unit control,
              six baggage cars, one mail car, one baggage car, two coaches, and
              one sleeping car, in the order named. All cars ware of all-steel
              construction. This train departed from Chattanooga at 12:16 p.m.,
              36 minutes late, and passed signal 226RA, which indicated Proceed,
              at 4:43 p.m., 1 hour 14 minutes late. While it was moving at an
              estimated speed of 35 miles per hour the second to the tenth cars,
              *** and the front truck of the eleventh car were derailed at a
              point 674 feet north of the south siding-switch at Danley.</p>
            <p>The train stopped with the front end of the locomotive 911 feet
              north of the point of derailment. A separation occurred between
              the seventh and eighth cars, and these cars stopped with the north
              end of the seventh car 6 feet 6 inches north of the north end of
              the eighth car. There were no other separations between the units
              of the train. The derailed equipment was derailed toward the east
              and stopped approximately in line with the track. The second, third,
              and eleventh cars remained upright; the seventh car leaned toward
              the west at an angle of. approximately 30 degrees; and the other
              derailed cars leaned toward the west at angles of from 5 to 50
              degrees. The eleventh car was slightly damaged, and the other derailed
              wore somewhat damaged. The weather was clear at the time of the
              accident which occurred at 4:45 p.m.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>As No. 94 was approaching the point whore the accident occurred
              the engineman were maintaining a lookout ahead from their positions
              in the control compartment at the front of the locomotive. The
              members of the train crew were in the ninth car of the train. The
              engineer said that as the, train approached the curve on which
              the accident occurred the speed was reduced from 40 miles per hour,
              as indicated by the speed-indicating device, to about 35 miles
              per hour. The members of the crew said that the locomotive and
              the cars were riding-smoothly, and until the brakes became applied
              in emergency as a result of the derailment they noticed indications
              of defective track or equipment.</p>
            <p>Examination of the locomotive and cars after thc accident occurred
              disclosed no defective condition which could have caused or contributed
              to the cause of the derailment. Examination of the track throughout
              a considerable distance immediately south of the point of derailment
              disclosed no indications of dragging equipment nor of an obstruction
              having been on the track.</p>
            <p>Examination of the track at the point of derailment disclosed
              that all rail fastenings had been removed from a rail in the east
              side of the track and that this rail had been displaced as No.
              94 was passing over it. Northward from a point about 13 feet north
              of the south end of a rail, all rail-holding spikes had been removed
              throughout the remainder of the length of the rail. The plate-holding
              spikes had not been disturbed, and this rail remained in normal
              position on the tie plates. The joint bars had been removed from
              each end of the next rail to the north. This rail had been displaced
              from its position in the track as the train was passing over it,
              and it was found about 15 feet west of thc center-line of the track
              and parallel to it. It was about 9 feet north of its original position
              in the track. A number of the ties which had been under this rail
              had been demolished by derailed equipment. Examination of the ties
              on which the tie plates remained in place disclosed that all rail-holding
              spikes throughout the length of thc rail had been removed. Apparently
              the plate-holding spikes had not been disturbed prior to the time
              of the derailment. Throughout the area in which the rail-holding
              spikes had been removed the ties and tie plates bore fresh tool
              marks which appeared to have been made by the heel of a claw bar
              used in removing the spikes. The locations and appearance of these
              marks indicated that the car had been used by a person experienced
              in track work. The marks were fresh, and the absence of dust or
              dirt in the indentations indicated that they had been made within
              short time prior to the time of the derailment. At the receiving
              end of the next rail to the north of the displaced rail, the field
              side of the head of the rail was heavily battered. The south end
              of this rail had been forced to the west by derailed equipment,
              and the east wheels of thc following derailed equipment had passed
              to the right of the rail. North of this point the rails and ties
              had been displaced by derailed equipment throughout a dstance of
              about 390 feet. There were no broken rails and no other separations
              between the rails.</p>
            <p>The four joint bars which had been removed from the track were
              found about 50 feet east of the track and opposite the original
              location of the displaced rail. The appearance of these joint bars
              indicates that they had been removed from the track only a short
              time before they were found, and the positions in which they were
              found indicated that they had been carried to that point and had
              not been thrown from the track during the derailment. Track bolts,
              nuts, and spikes were also found in this vicinity. The bolts were
              intact and the threads had been freshly oiled, indicating that
              the nuts had been removed with a wrench. The spikes had the appearance
              of having been removed from the track only a short time before
              they were found. There were very few marks on the rail which was
              displaced from the track, and there was no batter on the ends.
              Apparently this rail was thrown out of the track almost immediately
              after it was dislodged from its normal position. The rail-head
              bond at the south end of this rail had been pulled apart, evidently
              at the time the rail was dislodged, and the bond at the north end
              of the rail had been sheared off by derailed equipment.</p>
            <p>Indications were found that an attempt bad also been made to remove
              the joint bars from a joint in the west rail. At the second joint
              south of the south end of the displaced rail the fourth bolt from
              the north end or the joint bar had been removed. Fresh tool marks
              on the nuts on the field side of the first, third, and fifth bolts
              from the north end of the joint bar indicated that attempts had
              bean made to remove those nuts. The tool marks were similar to
              those made by a standard track wrench.</p>
            <p>Apparently the person or persons who removed the rail fastenings
              from the east rail left the rail in place and did not disturb the
              bonds at the ends of the rail. The train dispatcher said that he
              noticed nothing unusual in the operation of the control machine
              of the traffic-control system on the day of the accident. Signal
              226RA displayed the normal aspect for the movement of No. 94, and
              the engineman of No. 94 noticed no unusual condition as the locomotive
              approached and passed over the point at which the derailment occurred.
              If the rail had been displaced the bond wires broken before No.
              94 passed signal 225RA, the signal should have indicated Stop.
              The signal system was tested after the track was repaired, and
              it functioned properly.</p>
            <p>On April 9 the track supervisor inspected thc track in the vicinity
              of the point of Accident from a track motor-car, and again from
              a locomotive on April 14. He detected no defective or unusual condition.
              A south-bound freight train consisting of 4 Diesel-electric unite,
              33 cars, and a caboose passed the point of accident about 6 hours
              before the accident occurred. The crew of this train noticed no
              unusual condition of the track,</p>
            <p>In the immediate vicinity of the point of accident there are no
              houses or highways, and it is probable that persons working on
              the track or tampering with the track at this point would not attract
              attention. At the time this investigation was completed the person
              or persons who removed the rail fastenings had not been apprehended.</p>
            <p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
            <p>This accident was caused by defective track due to malicious tampering.</p>
            <p>Dated at Washington D. C., this ninth day of May, 1955.</p>
            <p>By the Commission, Commissioner Clarke.</p>
