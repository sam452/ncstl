            <p>INV. 305; Accident Type: HE</p>
            <p>NOVEMBER 24, 1915.</p>
            <p>IN EX INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON</p>
            <p>THE EASEVILLE, CHATTANOOGA AND ST. LOUIS RAILWAY,</p>
            <p>NEAR DALTON, GEORGIA, OCTOBER 30, 1915.</p>
            <p>On October 30, 1915, there was a head-and collision between two 
              freight trains on the Mashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway 
              near Dalton, Ca., which resulted in the death of one employee. After 
              investigation the Chief of the Division of Safety reports as follows:</p>
            <p>Southbound train No. 13 consisted of 35 loaded cars and a caboose, 
              hauled by locomotive 394, and was in charge of Conductor Keel and 
              Engineman Bohler. This was a third-class train and left Chattanooga, 
              Tenn., at 1,10 a.m., arriving at Graysville, Ca., the last open 
              telegraph station before reaching Dalton, at 3:40 a.m., where the 
              crew in charge received a copy of train order No. 404, reading as 
              follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>&quot;Passing track at Dalton blocked at north *** with car derailed, 
                Southbound trains can not hold in passing track.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Train No. 13 left Graysville at 2:45 a.m. and arrived at Dalton 
              about 3:48 a.m., coming to a stop with the locomotive at the standpipe, 
              about 250 feet south of the train order board, which was in the 
              stop position. The conductor immediately went to the telegraph office 
              and signed the following order addressed to his train:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&quot;Order No. 507. October 30, 1915.</p>
              <p>Extra 281 north will most second No. 15 eng 405 at Bests and 
                has rights over No. 15, No. 10 and NO. 7 Rogers to Dalton. Eag 
                306 on second No. 55.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Order No. 511. October 30, 1915.</p>
              <p>No. 50 eng 395 will wait at Reason until five one 301 a.m. for 
                No. 13 eng 394.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>At 3:52 a.m., train No. 13 pulled down for the purpose of backing 
              in the passing track and at 3:54 a.m., while running at a speed 
              of about 10 miles an hour, collided with northbound extra 281, at 
              a point 435 feet south of the south switch, 400 feet north of the 
              yard limit board and approximately 3, 400 feet south of the station 
              at Dalton.</p>
            <p>Northbound *** 261 consisted of locomotive 251, 5 loaded cars, 
              22 empty cars and a caboose, and was in charge of Conductor Bill 
              and Engineman Win. This train left Atlanta, Ga., October 29th, at 
              9:15 p.m., arriving at Rogers, Ca., October 30th, at about 1:20 
              a.m., at which place the crew in charge received train order No. 
              307. Extra 301 passed *** the last telegraph station, at 3:50 a.m., 
              and collided with train No. 13 while running at a speed of 4 or 
              3 miles on hour. </p>
            <p>This part of the Nashville, Chatsancoga and St. Louis Railway is 
              a single-track line. Train movements are governed by time-table 
              and train orders, there being no block signal system is use. The 
              main line of the Southern Railway parallels the tracks of the Kashville, 
              Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, beginning where they cross each 
              other, 460 feet south of the station at Dalton, and extending southward 
              for more than two miles. The distance between the two main tracks 
              varies from 40 to 100 feet.</p>
            <p>Approaching the point of accident from the north, beginning at 
              Dalton station, the track is tangent for 330 feet, followed by a 
              2-degree curve to the right 985 feet in length. It is then tangent 
              for about 1,000 feet to the beginning of a 2-degree curve to the 
              left one-half mile in length, roar the northern and of which this 
              accident accrued. The grade at the point of accident is slightly 
              descending for southbound trains, the track being on a fill of about 
              five feet. The physical conditions surrounding the point of collision 
              were such as to afford as unobstructed view for a distance of 1,000 
              feet in both directions. The weather at the time of the accident 
              was clear.</p>
            <p>The force of the collision *** the derailment of both engines, 
              three cars in extra 281 and five cars in train No. 13, the engines 
              remaining in an upright position after derailment. Extra 281 was 
              forced backward about 10 feet and the locomotives of both trains 
              were badly damaged, the engineman of train No. 13 being killed in 
              the collision.</p>
            <p>Conductor Keel, of train No. 13, stated that when his train reached 
              Dalton the trains order board was in the stop position and be hastened 
              to the telegraph office, where he signed two train orders, one of 
              which was order No. 507 giving extra 281 rights over his train to 
              Dalton. While he was waiting for the dispatcher to complete the 
              orders, the bead brakeman approached and be instructed him to tall 
              the engineman to pull down and back in on the passing track for 
              southbound passenger train No. 3, due at Dalton at 4:01 a.m., and 
              that an extra was to meet then there. Conductor Keel further stated 
              that his train started away from the standpipe, for the purpose 
              of backing in on the passing track, at about 3:52 a.m. conductor 
              Keel stated that this movement was made without protection and that 
              he did not instruct the head brakeman to go ahead with a flag, in 
              order to protect his train, because under the rules he was not required 
              to do so within yard limits. He further stated that although he 
              would have had time to personally deliver the order to the enginman, 
              instead of instructing the brakeman to do so, it was not *** for 
              conductors to do this, He received the competed orders as the caboose 
              was passing the station and then started to walk toward his train, 
              and when about 30 or 40 yards from the telegraph office he heard 
              the crash of the collision. He immediately went to the engine to 
              ascertain the trouble and then returned to the telegraph office, 
              accompanied by Conductor Vandivers, of train No. 3, which had come 
              to a step behind his train. He requested the operator, who had heard 
              the instructions he had given the head brakeman, to repeat then, 
              whereupon the operator said that he had directed the head brakeman 
              to tell the engineman to pull down and back in as they were to meet 
              and extra there, Conductor Foal thought the speed of his train was 
              not more then 7 or 8 miles an hour when his caboose passed the station.</p>
            <p>Fireman Pratt, of train No. 13, stated that because the north and 
              of the passing track at Dalton was blocked by derailed cars, his 
              train proceed down the main track at Dalton and come to a stop at 
              the standpipe just south of the train order board, expecting to 
              leave there ahead of train No. 3. However, the train order signal 
              was in the stop position an they passed the station and while they 
              were taking water the head brakeman came to the engine and instructed 
              Engineman *** to pull down pull down and back in for No. 3. He did 
              not *** anything about extra 361 meeting them there. Fireman Pratt 
              further stated that as his train passed the south switch he saw 
              extra 281 approaching around the *** At first he though it was a 
              train on the Southern Railway, but as it drew never he saw that 
              it was on their track, called to the engineman, &quot;Extra,&quot; 
              and leaped through the each window. He estimated the speed of his 
              train to have been about 12 miles an hour at the time of collision.</p>
            <p>Head Brakeman Black, of train NO. 13 stated that at Dalton he followed 
              Conductor Keel to the telegraph office and while outside the window 
              Conductor Keel instructed him to tall Engineman Shower to pull down 
              and back in at the south switch of the passing track, for train 
              NO. 3. He stated that he was receptive that Conductor Keel monitored 
              nothing to him regarding an extra; he did not know what the orders 
              were, and was unaware of the fact that an extra was to meet them 
              there. He delivered his instructions, as he understood them, to 
              Engineman Bohler, telling him to pull down and back in for train 
              No. 3. At the train left the standpipe he climbed to the top of 
              the fifteenth car in the train in order to be in a position to transfer 
              signals to the eingineman. When the engine of his train was about 
              12 or 13 car lengths south of the of the south switch of the passing 
              track he saw the electric headlight on his train shimming on the 
              front and of the engine of extra 281. The headlight on that train 
              was not burning. He felt the brakes being *** just before the collision. 
              No further stated that he would have protected his train by flag, 
              had he known that in making this movement it would have been necessary 
              to go beyond the yard limit board. He thought that his train would 
              not get beyond the yard limit board in order to backin at the south 
              switch. He though the speed of his train at the time of collision 
              was about 8 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>Engineman win, of extra 381, stated that approaching Dalton his 
              train was traveling at the rate of 30 or 25 miles an hour when he 
              shut off steam and began to apply the brakes. As he passed the yard 
              limit board he had reduced the speed of his train to 6 8 miles an 
              hour and had his train well under control as it entered the straight 
              track a short distance south of the point of accident. He could 
              then plainly see the electric headlight of train No. 13, although 
              it appeared to him as if that train were either at or coming down 
              to the south switch for the purpose of leaving a car. He kept his 
              brakes applied and, when within a distance of 7 or 8 car lengths 
              from train NO. 13, he realized that it was approaching at a speed 
              of about 15 miles an hour. He immediately applied the brakes in 
              emergency, got down in the *** and stopped of his train at the time 
              was 4 or 5 miles an hour. He stated that the electric headlight 
              on his engine had failed about two miles south of Dalton and that 
              he did not have sufficient time to stop, out in a new carbon, and 
              reach Dalton for train NO. 3.</p>
            <p>Rule 93, of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis.</p>
            <p>Railway, reads as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>&quot;Certain yards will be indicated by yard or station limit 
                signs. Within such limits the main track may be used, protecting 
                against first and second class trains. Third class and extra trains 
                must move on the main track under much control that they can stop 
                within the range of their vision.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Rule No. 99 provides in part as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>&quot;When a train stops or is delayed, under circumstances in 
                which it may be struck, the flagman must go back immediately with 
                stop signals a sufficient distance to insure full production, 
                ***.</p>
              <p>&quot;The front of a train must be protested in the same way 
                be the front brakeman. If the front brakeman is unable to got, 
                the fireman must go.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>On account of the passing track at Dalton being blocked at its 
              northern end, it was necessary for train No. 13 to proceed southward 
              on the main track and back in, order to clear train NO. 3. The main 
              track between the south switch and the yard limit board would only 
              hold 81 cars and, as train No. 13 conceited of a locomotive, 35 
              cars and a caboose, it would have been necessary, therefore, for 
              that train to go some distance beyond the yard limit board in order 
              to back in at the south switch of the passing track.</p>
            <p>Conductor Keel was aware of this necessity and in view of the fact 
              that he was the only member of the crew of train NO. 13 who know 
              that extra 381 had rights over his train to Dalton, he should have 
              had his trains *** Proper regard for the safety of his train should 
              have prompted him to personally explain to Engineman Bohler the 
              movement it was necessary for them to make under *** conditions, 
              instead of intrusting this duty to the head brakeman, particularly 
              in view of the fact that he did not ascertain whether or not the 
              letter thoroughly understood him instructions. Conductor Keel is 
              positive in his statement that he instructed him head brakeman properly 
              about meeting extra 281 at Dalton, while the head brakeman is just 
              as positive in his statement that he received no such instructions; 
              so that this matter resolves itself into a question of veracity 
              between these two employees.</p>
            <p>This accident was caused by the failure of train No. 13 to move 
              within yard limits under such control that it could have been brought 
              to a stop within the range of vision, for which Engineman Bohler 
              and Conductor Keel are responsible.</p>
            <p>Each locomotive involved in this accident was equipped with a high-power 
              electric headlight. The carbon in the one on locomotive 281 had 
              burned out after leaving the last station, and the engineman did 
              not have time to stop and repair it and make Dalton for train NO. 
              31. The headlight on train No. 13, however, was in good condition 
              and it is believed that had the engine crew on this train been on 
              the alert or had the headlight on extra 281 been burning, they could 
              have been the engine of the approaching extra in time to have brought 
              their train to a stop in time to prevent this accident.</p>
            <p>Engineman Bohler had been employed as an engineman on this railway 
              since 1905. Conductor Keel had been in the employ of this company 
              at conductor since 1903. Head Brakeman Black entered the service 
              of this railway December 14, 1909.</p>
            <p>At the time of the accident, the employees on train No. 13 had 
              only been on duty 3 hours and 34 minutes; and the employees on extra 
              381, 7 hours and 7 minutes.<br>
