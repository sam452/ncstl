              REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY CONCERNING AN ACCIDENT
              ON THE LINE OF THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST. LOUIS RAILWAY
              NEAR BARTOW, GA., ON APRIL 17, 1933.<br>
              <br>
              June 12, 1933.<br>
              <br>
              To the Commission:<br>
              <br>
              On April 17, 1933, there was a derailment of a Louisville &amp; Nashville
              passenger train on the track of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St.
              Louis Railway near Bartow, Ga., which resulted in the death of
              2 employees and 2 trespassers, and the injury of 6 passengers,
              and 5 dining-car employees. This investigation was made in conjunction
              with a representative of the Georgia Public Service Commission.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Location and method of operation</strong><br>
              <br>
              This accident occurred on that part of the Atlanta Division which
              extends between Atlanta and Junta, Ga., a distance of 47.81 miles,
              and is a single-track line over which trains are operated by time
              table, train orders, and an automatic block-signal system. This
              track is used jointly by the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad
              and the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway, and the
              latter road has charge of the operation. The accident occurred
              at a point 2,923.4 feet south of the south switch of a passing
              track at Bartow; approaching this point from the south, there is
              a 4 degrees 12&#8217; curve to the left 860 feet in length, tangent
              track for a distance of 80 feet, and then a 5 degrees 32&#8217; curve
              to the right 2,423 feet in length, the accident occurred on this
              latter curve at a point 1,623 feet from its southern end. The grade
              is generally descending for north-bound trains and is 0.48 per
              cent at the point of accident.<br>
              <br>
              The track is laid with 110-pound rails, 39 feet in length, with
              20 or 21 treated ties to the rail length, tieplated and double-spiked
              on the outside of the curves. The track is ballasted with slag
              and gauge rods are in use. The speed for passenger trains is restricted
              to 45 miles per hour.<br>
              <br>
              The weather was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred
              about 8:03 p.m.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Description</strong><br>
              <br>
              North-bound Louisville &amp; Nashville passenger train no. 18 consisted
              of 1 storage mail and express car, 1 express car, 1 combination
              baggage car and coach, 1 coach, 5 Pullman sleeping cars, 1 dining
              car, and 1 observation car, all of steel construction, hauled by
              engine 421, and was in charge of Conductor Butcher and Engineman
              Evans; This train departed from Atlanta at 6:50 p.m., according
              to the train sheet, 35 minutes late, and at Bolton, 6.58 miles
              from Atlanta, the crew received a copy of a train order directing
              them to run 30 minutes late. The train passed Acworth, 7.18 miles
              south of the point of accident, at 7:52 p.m., 38 minutes late,
              and on approaching Bartow was derailed while traveling at a speed
              estimated to have been about 40 miles per hour.<br>
              <br>
              The engine, tender, first five cars and the front truck of the
              sixth car were derailed. The engine, tender and first two cars
              stopped on the side of a cut, on their left sides to the left of
              the track; the pilot was 14 feet from the track and the rear end
              of the engine was 6 feet from the center of the track. The tender
              remained coupled to the engine. The distance between the track
              and the first two cars varied from 8 to 30 feet. The third car
              was diagonally across the track leaning toward the left, and the
              fourth and fifth cars remained upright in line with the track.
              The employees killed were the engineman and fireman.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Summary of evidence</strong><br>
              <br>
              Conductor Butcher stated that he was riding in the third car of
              the train and noticed nothing unusual until the brakes were applied
              in emergency, followed by the derailment. He had not paid particular
              attention to the speed, but thought the highest speed attained
              was about 40 miles per hour and that the train was traveling at
              that speed at the time of the accident, and he said he did not
              notice any application of the brakes on the long descending grade
              approaching the point of accident. Conductor Butcher further stated
              that a terminal test of the air brakes was made at Atlanta and
              the brakes were reported to be working properly and while en route
              he had locked out along the train but had noticed nothing wrong,
              neither did there appear to be anything wrong with the track or
              with the riding of the cars.<br>
              <br>
              Flagman Rodgers, who was in the observation car, noticed no unusual
              speed and looked out at several points en route to inspect the
              train; the first he knew of anything wrong was when he was thrown
              from his seat against the front of the car; it was his opinion
              that this was due to the impact and not to an application of the
              brakes, as there was considerable rebound to the car which made
              him think that the train had struck something. He went back immediately
              to flag but did not see any marks or anything about the track that
              might have contributed to the accident.<br>
              <br>
              Section Foreman Mitchell, in charge of the section on which this
              accident occurred, stated that the last work performed in the vicinity
              of the point of accident was on March 30, when he did some leveling,
              lining, and tamping of a few low joints, and he last patrolled
              the track on April 15, going over it on foot. The line and surface
              were good, ties in good condition, and the ballast was up to the
              tops of the ties; the superelevation, which was 5 1/2 inches, was
              uniform. The rails were worn off about 1/2 inch, but had not reached
              the condemning limit and were in fairly good condition, all of
              them measuring above 2 inches. While there were a few angle bars
              on this curve that indicated that wheel flanges had touched them,
              Section Foreman Mitchell did not think that the flanges had ridden
              them hard enough to wear the bars, but rather that the slivers
              of metal found on the angle bars came from the ball of the rail.
              He said he had pulled the slivers off the rails and angle bars
              on several occasions but had net examined them closely, supposing
              that they came from the rails. Section Foreman Mitchell further
              stated that he kept a tight gauge on the curves, in his section,
              and if the gauge became 1/2 inch open he would give it attention.<br>
              <br>
              Track Supervisor Oliphant stated that the rails and angle bars
              were worn on this curve and that the same condition existed on
              other curves, but no trouble had ever been experienced as a result
              of that condition. The horizontal wear on the rails was about 5/8
              inch, none of them being worn down below 2 inches. They were laid
              in the spring of 1926 and new rails were lying along the track
              preparatcry to being laid. The rails on the high side of the curve
              are well oiled. Supervisor Oliphant stated that the last time he
              rode an engine over that section of track before the occurrence
              of the accident was about the first of April, at which time the
              engine rode smoothly. After the accident he found four or five
              broken rails in the wreckage, but as a result of his examination
              he was unable to say what caused the accident.<br>
              <br>
              Division Engineer Anderson, of the NC&amp;STL, stated that none
              of the rails was worn down close to the limit, all of them measuring
              well over 2 inches, and that while they were to have been taken
              out, this was because they were to be used in patching the track
              on other curves, otherwise they would have been left in place for
              another year. He did not consider a rail to be unsafe until it
              was worn below 1 5/8 inches, nor did he consider it unsafe when
              the gauge side of the outer rail on a curve was worn to such an
              extent that it conformed to the shape of a wheel flange, and he
              said that in his opinion a wheel with a vertical flange worn 1
              3/8 inches in depth would pass safely around such a curve at a
              train speed of 40 miles per hour even if the flange were touching
              the angle bars; in fact, they have many other curves where flanges
              touch the angle bars and no trouble has developed. He was unable
              to state what the distance would be between the top of the angle
              bar on the gauge side of the rail and the top of the rail, but
              Chief Engineer Blackie stated that on the new rails the distance
              was about 1 1/4 inches.<br>
              <br>
              In a report from the division engineer to the superintendent, dated
              April 21, it was stated that the first marks on the track were
              at a point about 490 feet south of the front end of the engine,
              consisting of a flange mark on a tie near the east or low rail
              and a flange mark on the web of the high rail, this latter mark
              extending northward about 50 feet and apparently having been made
              by the front truck of the sixth car, which was standing at that
              point when the train stopped. The next mark on the web of the rail
              commenced 7 1/2 feet beyond and extended northward 43 feet. From
              this point northward for a distance of 100 feet there were numerous
              flange marks in the web of the rails and on the ties up to the
              point where the track was demolished. North of the demolished track,
              the ties were marked for a distance of 49 feet, these marks gradually
              becoming less pronounced, and then for a distance of 171 feet to
              a point opposite where the head end of the engine stopped there
              were no marks of derailment. Beginning with the high rail where
              the first flange mark appeared on the web, the first two rails
              were turned ever but still connected, with the north end of the
              second rail off the ties. The next six rails were scattered at
              various points and after the wreckage was cleared they were assembled
              and it was found that four of these rails had been broken and the
              others badly bent; a triangular piece near the leaving end of the
              fourth rail could not be found. All the breaks were clean cut and
              sharp at the ball of the rail and there were no indications that
              a wheel had run ever the ball of the rail after the breaks occurred.
              No marks were found on the ball of the rail which could be identified
              as flange marks. Measurements of the track taken south of the point
              of accident showed that the elevation varied from 5 3/8 inches
              to 5 9/16 inches and the gauge from 4 feet 8 1/2 inches to 4 feet
              8 7/8 inches.<br>
              <br>
              Division Engineer Lockhart, of the L&amp;N, stated that two of
              the breaks in the rails could have occurred under the engine, as
              the leaving end of the rails at the break was undeformed and the
              receiving end of the adjoining section was deformed; the fourth
              rail, from which a piece was missing, showed the leaving end of
              the broken section undefaced and the receiving end badly battered,
              indicating that something had struck it a terrific blow on the
              right upper corner, which could have been done by a driving wheel,
              but there wore no marks indicating that a flange had passed over
              the rail; he found no fissures in any of the breaks. Division Engineer
              Lockhart found the track south of the point of derailment to be
              in good gauge, elevation and surface.<br>
              <br>
              General Car Foreman Carmen, of the NC&amp;STL, who arrived at the
              scene with the wreck train, stated that he made an inspection of
              the equipment soon after the accident and again after it was picked
              up but could find nothing that could have contributed to the cause
              of the accident.<br>
              <br>
              Master Mechanic Oakley, of the L&amp;N, stated that he made a very
              careful examination of the engine and found all flanges practically
              in perfect condition with the exception of the left lead wheel
              on the rear tender truck, which was worn to some extent but had
              not reached the condemning limit. The lateral in both engine trucks
              did not exceed 5/16 inch and on no driving wheel did the lateral
              exceed 3/16 inch. All spring rigging, spring saddles and driving
              springs on the engine were in good condition and there was no indication
              of any part of the engine having been binding. It was his opinion
              that the accident was due to a broken rail.<br>
              <br>
              Engine Inspector and Machinist Garwood, of the L&amp;N, stated
              that he inspected engine 421 at the Atlanta Terminal before its
              departure on the day of the accident and found the shoes and wedges,
              tires, engine and trailer trucks and brake rigging in good condition.<br>
              <br>
              Car Inspectors A. E. Almand and C. W. Almand, of the NC&amp;STL,
              inspected train no. 18 before its departure from Atlanta, both
              as to running gear and air brakes, and found it in good condition.<br>
              <br>
              A careful examination of the engine and cars made by the Commission&#8217;s
              inspectors failed to disclose any defects that could have contributed
              to the cause of the accident; there was slight wear on the left
              front wheel of the rear tender truck, but it was not sufficient
              to be condemnable. The track was so badly torn up that it was impossible
              to determine the initial point of derailment, and although several
              of the rails were broken there were no indications of fissures
              and no positive evidence that those breaks had occurred prier to
              the derailment. There was considerable flange wear, however, on
              the gauge side of the cuter rail on the curve, the heads of the
              rails being worn to such an extent that the wheel flanges were
              riding on top of the angle bars, which also were considerably worn,
              the metal ground off the tops of the angle bars being rolled out
              along the top against the ball of the rail so that the rail conformed
              to the shape of a wheel-flange, materially increasing the traction
              against the high rail.<br>
              <br>
              The train sheet record showed train no. 18 as passing Elizabeth
              at 7:37 p.m. and Acworth at 7:52 p.m. The distance between these
              points is 12.81 miles, and the 15 minutes consumed indicates that
              the average speed was about 51 miles per hour. The distance from
              Acworth to the point of accident is about 8 miles and with the
              train traveling this distance in 11 minutes it shows an average
              speed of nearly 44 miles per hour. The average speed for the 21
              miles from Elizabeth to the point of accident was about 48 miles
              per hour.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
              <br>
              This accident is believed to have been caused by failure of the
              track under the train.<br>
              <br>
              Examination of the train equipment failed to disclose any condition
              which might have contributed to this accident except a worn flange
              on one of the tender wheels. Examination of the track showed that
              the rails were curve-worn, with the flanges of the wheels coming
              in contact with the angle bars, and there were also four rails
              on the high side of the curve which were broken, none of which,
              however, showed any defects. The gauge and elevation of the track
              south of the wreckage were well maintained, and there was nothing
              to indicate that excessive speed was the cause, and in view of
              the way the track was torn up or buckled under the train, making
              it difficult to ascertain the initial point of derailment, it was
              impossible to determine the exact cause of the accident.<br>
