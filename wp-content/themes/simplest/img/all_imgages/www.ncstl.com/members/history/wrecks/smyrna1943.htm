            <p>THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST. LOUIS RAILWAY COMPANY</p>
            <p>April 27, 1943.</p>
            <p>Accident at Smyrna, Tenn., on March 1, 1943, caused by an engine
              fouling the main track immediately in front of an approaching train
              without authority or protection.</p>
            <p>REPORT OF THE COMMISSION</p>
            <p>PATTERSON, Commissioner:</p>
            <p>On March 1, 1943, there was a side collision between a freight
              train and an engine on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis
              Railway at Smyrna, Tenn., which resulted in the death of one employee
              and the injury of four employees.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/smyrna1943.jpg" width="661" height="985"></p>
            <p align="center">Inv. No. 2684 Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; ST. Louis Railway Smyrna,
              Tenn. March 1, 1943</p>
            <p><strong>Location of Accident and Method of Operation</strong></p>
            <p>This accident occurred on that part of the Chattanooga Division
              which extends between Cowan and Nashville, Tenn., 87.36 miles.
              In the vicinity of the point of accident this is a single-track
              line over which trains are operated by timetable, train orders
              and an automatic block-signal system. At Smyrna a siding 4,454
              feet in length parallels the main track on the east. The north
              switch of this siding is 1,458 feet north of the station. The accident
              occurred at the fouling point of the turnout about 100 feet south
              of the north siding-switch. Approaching from the south the track
              is tangent a distance of more than 1 mile to the point of accident.
              At the point of collision the grade for north-bound trains is 0.9
              percent descending.</p>
            <p>A derail is located on the east rail of the siding at a point
              199 feet south of the switch and 14 feet south of the clearance
              point. This derail is connected to the north siding switch and
              operates in conjunction with it. When the north siding-switch is
              lined fox a main-track movement, the derail is in derailing position.
              An industry track 1,626 feet in length parallels the siding on
              the east. The north switch of this track is 605 feet south of the
              north siding-switch.</p>
            <p>Automatic signals 20-8 and l9-8, which govern north-bound movements,
              are located, respectively, 4,335 feet south and 218 feet north
              of the point of accident. These signals are of the color-light
              type and are approach lighted.</p>
            <p><strong>Operating rules read in part as follows:</strong></p>
            <p>99. When a train stops or is delayed, under circumstances in which
              it may be struck, the flagman must go back immediately with stop
              signals a sufficient distance to insure full protection, * * *</p>
            <p>* * *</p>
            <p>5l (c). A switch must not be opened to permit a train movement
              to the main track, nor must a train come within fouling distance
              of the main track, unless such train is authorized by rule, time-table
              or train order to occupy main track or is protected as required
              by Rule 99.</p>
            <p>Time-table special rules read in part as follows:</p>
            <p>9. Extras may pass and run ahead of third class trains.</p>
            <p>The maximum authorized speed for freight trains is 45 miles per
              hour.</p>
            <p><strong>Description of Accident</strong></p>
            <p>No. 20, a north-bound third-class freight train, consisting of
              engine 612, 10 loaded cars and a caboose, was en route from Cowan
              to Nashville. It entered the siding at Smyrna and stopped into
              clear at 4:37 p.m. About 6:34 p.m. engine 612, pulling 12 cars,
              was moving northward on the siding at a speed of about 2 miles
              per hour when the engine fouled the main track on the turnout of
              the north siding-switch and was struck by Extra 555 North.</p>
            <p>Extra 555 North, a north-bound freight train, consisted of engine
              555, 20 loaded and 10 empty cars and a caboose. This train departed
              from Murfreesboro, 11.48 miles south of Smyrna and the last open
              office, at 6:12 p.m., according to the dispatcher's record of movement
              of trains, passed signal 20-8, which displayed proceed, and while
              moving at a speed of about 12 miles per hour it collided with engine
              612. The brakes of this train had been tested and had functioned
              Properly en route.</p>
            <p>Engine 612 and the first car overturned to the right and stopped
              bottoms up and considerable damaged, east of the siding and parallel
              to it, with the front end of the engine opposite the north siding-switch.
              The second and third cars were derailed but remained upright and
              in line with the siding. The front truck of the third car was derailed.
              Engine 555 and its tender were derailed and stopped upright in
              line with the main track, with the front end of the engine about
              210 feet north of the point of accident. The pilot beam and the
              right *** broken. The first and second cars were slightly damaged.</p>
            <p>It was clear and daylight at the time of the accident, which occurred
              about 6:34 p.m.</p>
            <p>The employee killed was the engineer of No. 20. The employees
              *** were the swing brakeman of No. 20, and the engineer, the front
              brakeman and the flagman of Extra 555.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>The rules governing operation in automatic block-signal. territory
              on this line provide that flag protection must be furnished before
              a movement is made from a siding to the main track *** the movement
              is authorized by the rules or by train order. Extra trains may
              pass and run ahead of third-class trains. These requirements were
              understood by the surviving members of both crews involved.</p>
            <p>No. 20, a north-bound third-class freight train, entered the siding
              at Smyrna and stopped into clear at 4:37 p. m. About 6:34 p. m.
              while engaged in switching, the engine, pulling 12 cars, fouled
              the main track on the turnout of the north siding-switch and was
              struck by Extra 555 North. No train order restricting the authority
              or Extra 555 to proceed had been issued. Under the rules, the crew
              of No. 20 was required to provide flag protection before their
              engine moved beyond the clearance point of the north siding-switch.</p>
            <p>As Extra 555 was approaching Smyrna the speed was 25 or 30 miles
              per hour. The enginemen and the front brakeman were maintaining
              a lookout ahead. The last automatic signal passed by this train
              displayed proceed. The first warning the crew had of anything being
              wrong was when their engine reached a point about 1,200 feet south
              of the north siding-switch and they saw stop signals being given
              from a point about 200 feet distant. The engineer immediately moved
              the brake valve to emergency position but he could not stop his
              train short of engine 612. The speed of Extra 555 was about 12
              miles per hour when the collision occurred.</p>
            <p>The conductor of No. 20 said he received information from the
              operator at Smyrna about 5:35 p. m. that No. 94, a northbound first-class
              train, would pass Florence, 5.3 miles south of Smyrna, at 6:05
              p. m., and that Extras 575 and 555 North were following closely
              behind No. 94. He said he gave this information to his engineer
              but did not inform the front brakeman. No. 94 passed Smyrna about
              6:11 p. m. and Extra 575 passed about 6:29 p. m. About 6:33 p.
              m. engine 612 pulled 12 cars northward from the industry track
              to the siding and stopped with the engine standing just south of
              the derail. The conductor went to the station to confer with the
              dispatcher. He expected his engine to remain into clear on the
              siding until Extra 555 passed, but he did not instruct any member
              of his crew accordingly. The flagman was in the vicinity of the
              caboose at the south end of the siding. The conductor and the flagman
              said they did not know that their engine had fouled the main track
              until after the accident occurred. The swing brakeman said he gave
              signals for the engineer to stop the movement when he saw the engine
              and cars moving northward after the stop was made at the derail,
              but the signals were not acted upon. Then he ran to the main track
              and gave signals for Extra 555 to stop. The fireman and the front
              brakeman of No. 20 said their engineer instructed the front brakeman
              to open the north siding-switch soon after the stop was made at
              the derail. The front brakeman lined the switch for the siding
              but he did not see Extra 555 approaching in time to take action
              to prevent the accident. The fireman said he first saw Extra 555
              approaching when his engine entered the turnout. He called a warning
              to the engineer, who immediately moved the broke valve to emergency
              position but the engine could not he stopped short of the fouling
              point of the turnout. It could not be determined why the engineer
              of No. 20 permitted his engine to foul the main track without authority
              or protection, as he was killed in the accidents</p>
            <p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
            <p>It is found that this accident was caused by an engine fouling
              the main track immediately in front of an approaching train without
              authority or protection.</p>
            <p>Dated at Washington, D. C., this twenty-seventh day of April,
              l943.</p>
