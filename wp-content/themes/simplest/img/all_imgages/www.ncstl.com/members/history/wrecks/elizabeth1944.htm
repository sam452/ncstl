            <p><strong>              Diagram</strong></p>
            <p>              Inv. No. 2832 Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway Elizabeth,
              Ga. September 25, 1944</p>
            <p><strong>              Location of Accident and Method of Operation</strong></p>
            <p>              This accident occurred on that part of the railroad designated
                as the Atlanta Division and extending southward from Chattanooga,
                Tenn., to Atlanta, Ga., 136.53 miles. In the vicinity of the
                  point of accident this was a single-track line over which trains
                  were
                operated by signal indications. The accident occurred on the
                  main track 114.14 miles south of Chattanooga, at a point 0.91
                  mile north
                of Elizabeth. From the north there were, in succession, a 4 degrees
                26 curve to the left 1,026 feet in length, a 5 degrees 03 curve
                to the right 1,671 feet, and a 5 degrees 54 curve to the left
                  130 feet to the point of accident and 418 feet southward. The
                  grade
                for south-bound trains was 0.29 percent ascending.</p>
            <p>              On the curve the track structure consisted of 110-pound rail,
                  39 feet in length, laid on an average of 23 treated ties to
                  the rail
                length. It was fully tieplated, single-spiked in side and double-spiked
                outside the high rail, provided with 4 gage rods and 8 rail anchors
                per rail length, and was ballasted with gravel to a depth of
                  2 feet. The maximum superelevation was 3-1/4 inches end the
                  gage
                varied between feet 8-1/2 inches and 4 feet 8-7/8 inches. At
                  the point of accident the superelevation was 3-1/4 inches and
                  the gage
                was 4 feet 8-1/2 inches.</p>
            <p>              The maximum authorized speed for passenger trains was 45 miles
                per hour.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Description of Accident</strong></p>
            <p>              No. 3, a south-bound first-class passenger train, consisted of
                engine 559, a 4-8-2 type, one passenger-box car, one baggage
                  oar, one mail car, two baggage cars, four coaches and one Pullman
                  sleeping
                car, in the order named. All cars were of steel construction.
                  This train, departed from Chattanooga at 2:59 a.m., 4 minutes
                  late,
                passed Kennesaw, 6.86 miles north of Elizabeth, at 6:36 a.m.,
                  19 minutes late, and while moving at an estimated speed of
                  45 miles
                per hour the engine and the first 8 cars were derailed.</p>
            <p>              The engine and tender and the first and third cars stopped on
                  their right aides west of the track and practically parallel
                  to it, with
                the front end of the engine 385 feet south of the point of derailment
                The second car and the fourth to the eighth cars, inclusive,
                  stopped practically upright and in line with the track. The
                  engine and
                the first 6 cars were badly damaged, and the seventh and ninth
                cars were slightly damaged.</p>
            <p>              It was cloudy at the time of the accident, which occurred about
                6:42 a.m.</p>
            <p>              The engineer and the fireman were killed and the baggageman was
                injured.<br>
              The total weight of engine 559 In working order was 340,000 pounds,
                distributed as follows: Engine truck, 53,000 pounds; driving
                wheels, 224,000 pounds; and trailer truck, 63,000 pounds The
                diameters
                of the engine-truck wheels, the driving wheels and the trailer-truck
                wheels were, respectively, 33, 69, and 43 inches. The tender
                was equipped with four-wheel trucks. The rigid wheelbase of the
                engine
                was 18 feet 3 inches long, and the total length of the engine
                and tender was 87 feet 3 inches. The center of gravity was 75-3/5
                inches
                above the tops of the rails. The last class 3 repairs were completed
                on March 26, 1943.</p>
            <p><strong>              Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>No. 3 was moving at a speed of about 45 miles per hour in territory
                where the maximum authorized speed was 45 miles per hour when
                  the engine and the first 8 cars were derailed on a 5 degrees
                  54 curve
                to the left having a maximum superelevation of 3-1/4 inches.
                  The engine overturned to the right and stopped 385 feet south
                  of the
                point of derailment. There was no indication of dragging equipment,
                defective track, or of any obstruction having been on the track.
                It could not be determined when the enginemen first became aware
            of anything being wrong, as they were killed in the accident.</p>
            <p>              Examination of the track disclosed that, beginning at a point
                  130 feet south of the north end of the curve, flange marks
                  appeared
                on the web and the base on the inner side of the high rail, and
                this rail was canted outward. The three outer rails immediately
                south of this rail were overturned outward, and flange marks
                  appeared on the inner side of the web. South ward from the
                  third overturned
                rail the track was torn up to the point where the engine stopped.
                Examination of the engine disclosed that the right No. 3 driving
                wheel had moved outward 2 inches on its axle, and was firmly
                  secured in that position. The crank pins had moved outward
                  1/2 inch on
                the right No. 1 driving wheel and 7/16 inch on the right No.
                  3 driving wheel. The right No. 3 bushing collar was broken
                  in two
                places. The wheel-center and the axle keyways of the right No.
                3 driving wheel were badly battered, and were about 1/4 inch
                  wider than the key. It is evident from the manner in which
                  the rails
                were overturned that these conditions existed prior to the accidents
                As a result of the derailment the side rods were displaced from
                the right and the left sides of the No. 3 and No. 4 pairs of
                  driving wheels, the threaded trunnion ends were broken on the
                  right and
                left sides of the No. 3 and the right side of the No. 4 crank
                  pins, the threads of the crank pins were damaged and the cotter
                  key was
                sheared from the left No. 4 crank pin. The right No. 3 wheel-center
                was applied to the axle in August, 1937. Records of the carrier
                indicated that during a period of 18 days immediately prior to
                the accident engineers operating engine 559 had reported to the
                mechanical forces that the engine was pounding abnormally and
                  was riding roughly. Mechanical forces who examined this engine
                  in each
                Instance reported the engine suitable for service.</p>
            <p>              The surface, alinement and gage of the track in the vicinity
                  of the point of derailment were well maintained for the maximum
                  authorized
                speed of 45 miles per hour. The complaints made by the engineers
                operating this engine and the condition in which the right No.
                3 driving wheel assembly of engine 559 was found after the accident
                indicate that the wheel had gradually moved outward from its
                  normal position on the axle and had reached the maximum outward
                  displacement
                of approximately 2 inches when the engine entered the curve on
                which the accident occurred. Since the gage between the No. 3
                  driving wheels was about 2 inches wider than the gage between
                  the rails,
                a wedging effect was created and the high rail was canted outward.
                Then the right No. 3 driving wheel dropped to the web and base
                of the canted rail and following wheels completed the overturning
                of the rail.</p>
            <p><strong>              Cause</strong></p>
            <p>              It is found that this accident was caused by a driving wheel
                  moving outward on its axle.</p>
