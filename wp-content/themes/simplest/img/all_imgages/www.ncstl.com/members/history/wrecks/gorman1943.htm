              Accident at Gorman, Tenn., on March 17, 1943, caused by train fouling

            <p>              REPORT OF THE COMMISSION-1</p>
            <p>              PATTERSON, Commissioner:</p>
            <p>              On March 17, 1943, there was a side collision between a freight
              train and a passenger train on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St.
              Louis Railway at Gorman, Tenn., which resulted in the death of
              two train-service employees and the injury of one passenger, one
              Pullman employee and three train-service employees.</p>
            <p><strong>              Diagram</strong> </p>
            <p>              Inv. No. 2686 Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway Gorman,
              Tenn. March 17, 1943</p>
            <p><strong>              Location of Accident and Method of Operation</strong></p>
            <p>              This accident occurred on that part of the Nashville Division
                  extending between Bruceton and Nashville, Tenn., 94.87 miles.
                  In the vicinity
                of the point of accident this is a single-track line over which
                trains are operated by timetable and train orders. There is no
                block system in use. At Gorman a siding 3,578 feet in length
                  parallels the main track on the east. The north switch of this
                  siding is
                located 2,885.6 feet north of the station. The clearance point
                at the north end of the siding is 185 feet south of the switch.
                There is no mark or sign to indicate the location of the clearance
                point. The accident occurred 111 feet north of the clearance
                  point and 74 feet south of the north siding-switch; Approaching
                  from
                the south on the siding there is a tangent about 3,100 feet in
                length, which is followed by a 1 degree curve to the right 122.9
                feet to the clearance point at the north end of the siding. </p>
            <p>Approaching
                from the north on the main track there is a tangent more than
              2 miles in length, which is followed by a 1 degree curve to the
              left
                862.8 feet to the point of accident and 233.9 feet beyond. Throughout
                a considerable distance north and south of the point of collision
                the grade for north-bound trains varies between 1.52 and 0.25
              percent descending and at the point of accident it is 0.39 percent
              descending.</p>
            <p>              Operating rules read in part as follows:</p>
            <p>              87. Inferior trains must keep out of the way of superior trains

            <p>              <strong>Description of Accident</strong></p>
            <p>              Third 50, a north-bound third-class freight train, consisted
                  of engines 535 and 614, coupled, 56 empty cars and 2 cabooses,
                  in
                the order named. This train departed from Nashville, 61.82 miles
                south of Gorman, at 11:05 p.m., March 16, according to the dispatchers
                record of movement of trains, 2 hours 35 minutes late. At Colesburg,
                22.2 miles south of Gorman, the crew received a clearance card
                and copies of three train orders, of which two were orders Nos.
                6 and 8, reading in part as follows:</p>
            <p>              No. 6<br>
              Engs 654 623 and 533 run extra Bruceton to Nashville have right
                over *** Third No 50 Eng 535 Bruceton to Colesburg ***</p>
            <p>              No. 8<br>
              Three Exs 654 623 and 533 South wait at *** Gorman until three
                twenty 320 a m ***</p>
            <p>              Third 50 departed from Colesburg at 1:53 a.m., March 17, 3 hours
                43 minutes late, entered the siding at Gorman and stopped into
                clear about 3:15 a.m. Soon afterward this train moved northward
                on the siding and stopped about 3:19 a.m., with the front end
                  of the first engine fouling the main track 74 feet south of
                  the north
                siding-switch. Immediately afterward it was struck by Extra 654
                South.</p>
            <p>              Extra 654 South, a south-bound passenger train, consisted of
                  engine 654, of the L2 class, 3 baggage cars, 4 Pullman tourist
                  cars, 1
                baggage car, 4 Pullman tourist cars, 1 baggage car, 2 Pullman
                  tourist cars and 1 Pullman sleeping car, in the order named.
                  The first,
                second, eighth and thirteenth cars were of steel underframe constriction.
                At Bruceton, 33.05 miles north of Gorman, the crew received a
                  clearance card and copies of train orders Nos. 6 and 8. This
                  train departed
                from Bruceton at 2:10 a.m., according to the dispatchers record
                of movement of trains, departed from Johnsonville, 15.9 miles
                  north of Gorman and the last open office, at 2:50 a.m., and
                  while moving
                at a speed of 25 or 30 miles per hour it collided with Third
                  50.</p>
            <p>              Engine 535 and its tender were derailed and badly damaged. The
                engine stopped bottom up east of the siding and at an angle of
                about 20 degrees to it. The tender stopped on its right side
                  east of the siding. Engine 654 and its tender were derailed
                  and stopped,
                headed northward, badly damaged, about 180 feet south of the
                  point of accident, on their left sides and west of the main
                  track. The
                first four cars of Extra 654 were derailed and stopped in various
                positions west of the main track. Of these cars, the first was
                demolished and the remainder were considerably damaged. The front
                truck of the fifth car was derailed.</p>
            <p>              There was a dense fog at the time of the accident, which occurred
                about 3:19 a.m.<br>
              The train-service employees killed were the fireman and the front
                brakeman of Extra 654. The train-service employees injured were
                the engineer of Extra 654 and the engineer and the front brakeman
                of Third 50.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Data</strong></p>
            <p>              The capacity of the siding at Gorman is 71 cars. The north siding-switch
                is provided with a stand about 7 feet high, located 6 feet 6
                  inches east of the east rail of the main track. When the switch
                  is lined
                for the main track an oblong target, painted green, about 2 feet
                long and 12 inches wide, is displayed at right angles to the
                  track and, in addition, a switch lamp, equipped with reflex
                  lenses, displays
                a green aspect.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>              The rules governing operation in this territory provide that
                  at meeting points the inferior train must, when practicable,
                  enter
                the siding at the nearest switch and must not pass the clearance
                point of the leaving switch without authority or flag protection.</p>
            <p>              The crews of both trains held copies of train order No. 6, which
                gave Extra 654 South right over Third 50 Bruceton to Colesburg,
                and train order No. 8, which required Extra 654 to wait at Gorman,
                22.2 miles north o Colesburg, until 3:20 a.m. The capacity of
                  the siding at Gorman is 71 cars. Third 50, consisting of 2
                  engines,
                56 cars and 2 cabooses, entered the siding at Gorman and stopped
                into clear about 3:15 a.m. About 4 minutes later, after this
                  train had moved northward on the siding and stopped, the front
                  end of
                the first engine fouled the main track at a point 74 feet south
                of the north siding-switch and was struck by Extra 654.</p>
            <p>              As Extra 654 was approaching Gorman the speed was about 40 miles
                per hour. The enginemen and the front brakeman were maintaining
                a lookout ahead. The headlight was lighted and there was no condition
                of the engine which obscured the view or distracted their attention.
                Because of dense fog, visibility at many places was restricted
                to a distance of about 25 or 30 feet. When the engine was approaching
                the station-one-mile sign, located 3,227 feet north of the north
                siding-switch, *** engineer closed the throttle to drifting position
                to control the speed of his train in such manner that it would
                not pass the clearance point at the south siding-switch prior
                  to 3:20 a.m. in compliance with train order No. 8. When the
                  engine
                passed the station-one-mile sign the engineer sounded the engine
                whistle arid observed the time as being 3:19:10 a.m. He momentarily
                saw the reflection of a light in the vicinity of the north siding-switch,
                but he thought it was the reflection of the headlights of an
                  automobile moving on a highway which parallels the track on
                  the west in that
                vicinity. His first knowledge of anything being wrong was when
                the collision occurred. No warning was given by the front brakeman
                or the firemen. It could not be determined when they first became
                aware that Third 50 had fouled the main track, as they were killed
                in the accident.</p>
            <p> The enginemen of the first engine of Third 50 said they first
                    became aware that their engine had fouled the main track
              about 2 seconds
                  prior to the collision. The engineer of the first engine said
                    that when his train first stopped into clear on the siding
                    his engine
                  was some distance south of the north siding-switch. Because
              it was customary for trains using a siding to proceed to the clearance
                  point at the leaving switch, his train proceeded northward
              on
                    the siding. The enginemen were maintaining a lookout ahead
                    and the
                  headlight was lighted, but because of the dense fog they wore
                    unable to determine the location of their engine with respect
                    to the clearance
                  point at the north end of the siding until their train had
              fouled the main track. There was no sign or mark to indicate the
              clearance
                  point. The front brakeman, who was on the second engine, and
                    the enginemen of the second engine were not aware that the
                    first engine
                had fouled the main track until the collision occurred.</p>
            <p>              If the clearance point at the north end of the siding had been
                provided with a distinctive sign to indicate the fouling point,
                the engineer of the first engine of Third 50 would have been
                  aware of his location with respect to the clearance point,
                  and this accident
                would have been averted.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Cause</strong></p>
            <p>              It is found that this accident was caused by a train fouling
                  the main track immediately, in front of an opposing superior
                  train.</p>
            <p>              Dated at Washington, D. C., this first day of May, 1943.</p>
