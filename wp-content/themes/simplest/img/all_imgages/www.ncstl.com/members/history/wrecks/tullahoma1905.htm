            <p>Nashville Banner, Friday evening, January 27, 1905</p>
            <p><strong>Passenger And Freight Train Collide.<br>
              <br>
              FOUR MEN REPORTED KILLED.<br>
              <br>
              Several Passengers Receive Injuries Of a More or Less Serious Nature.<br>
              <br>
              Engines are Demolished</strong></p>
            <p>Special to the Banner, Tullahoma, Tenn., January 27.</p>
            <p>This morning at 12:15 o&#8217;clock, No. 14, a northbound freight, 
              collided with No. 3, a southbound passenger train, and swept four 
              men into eternity, without warning. The collision wrecked two of 
              the finest engines on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis 
              Railway, and made kindling wood of the five freight cars, scattering 
              merchandise in every direction. The men killed were:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> ENGINEER JOSEPH SUGGS of the freight train.<br>
                ENGINEER WILLIAM RAY of the passenger train.<br>
                HORACE SUGGS, fireman on the passenger train.<br>
                JOHN RUSSELL, colored porter.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Father and Son.</strong><br>
              The dead men all live in Nashville. One of the most pitiful incidents 
              of the terrible wreck was that the two Suggs&#8217; were father 
              and son, the son being fireman on the No. 3 going south, while the 
              father was driver on the freight, going north. The engines were 
              little more than so much scrap iron. Four box cars were literally 
              torn into splinters, and the merchandise was thrown up in a pile 
              on top of the wreck.</p>
            <p> <strong>Miraculous Escape.</strong><br>
              The express car, with the through freight, on the passenger, was 
              next to the engine and was telescoped to the tender. Just how Wm. 
              O. King,the messenger, escaped without a scratch seems little less 
              than a miracle.<br>
              Mr. King states that when the crashcame, he was seated in the middle 
              of the car checking up his books, and before he knew what was taking 
              place, he was hurled against the far end of the car and two crates 
              containing two head of fine cattle consigned to Fitzgerald, Ga., 
              were hanging immediately above. He crawled out without being hurt, 
              and the cattle also escaped without a bruise.</p>
            <p> <strong>How It Happened.</strong><br>
              There are conflicting statements as to how fast the trains were 
              traveling, but from the best sources it is safe to say that when 
              the impact came the passenger was going at about fifteen miles an 
              hour, and the freight was going a a good haps twenty miles an hour. 
              The freight engineer was trying to make the siding, which is about 
              1,500 feet from the depot, ahead of the passenger,which was due 
              at Tullahoma at 12:20 o&#8217;clock. The track where the catastrophe 
              occured is perfectly straight for five or six miles, and it is incomprehensible 
              as to how such an accident could take place, under the conditions.</p>
            <p> <strong>Horribly Mangled.</strong><br>
              The bodies of the dead men were horribly mangled and that of Engineer 
              Sugg was almost burned to a crisp. The passengers on the train were 
              very badly shaken up, but so far as known one were dangerously hurt. 
              The following were among those who were painfully hurt:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> J. H. Jordan, brakeman, who was on his way to Chattanooga to 
                come out with his train, had a severe cut above the right eye 
                and head bruised.</li>
              <li> W. J. West, Sheriff of Scott County, home Huntsville, Tenn., 
                had ankle cut, bruised and head hurt.</li>
              <li>William Heddow, the conductor of the passenger, was badly shaken 
                and bruised and it is thought he was internally injured.</li>
              <li>W. C. Todd, Jingo, Williamson County, ankle hurt.</li>
              <li> Morris J. Connelly, Atlanta, hurt on head, not serious.</li>
              <li> L. T. Muse, Nashville, express messenger, hip hurt and back 
                wrenched.</li>
              <li> Sid Reynolds, baggagemaster, cut on wrist.</li>
              <li> E. Clayton, colored porter on Pullman, head hurt.</li>
              <li> Wynn Thomas of Nashville was slightly shaken up and bruised.</li>
              <li> Capt. Blevins of Rogersville was hurt on the ankle and bruised, 
                but not serious.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> <strong>Narrow Escapes.</strong><br>
              There were many who received minor wounds, but not enough to cause 
              inconvenience. E. L. Grubbs, the fireman on</p>
            <p>He states that Sugg, the engineer, called to him to jump, and then 
              tried to jump himself, but was too late. W. McGee, a brakeman, was 
              also on the freight engine, and saved himself by jumping. Hoodoo 
              Engine.</p>
            <p> The engines were passenger No. 254 and freight No. 183. They were 
              both among the best engines on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; 
              St. Louis Railway, but 254 is regarded as a hoody, this being her 
              third wreck. It was the most disastrous wreck ever had on the road. 
              James Granberry was severely injured by flying bar from the wreck.</p>
            <p> <strong>MISCALCULATION CAUSE</strong></p>
            <p> <strong>Engineer of Freight Evidently Did Not Know Passenger was 
              So Close.</strong></p>
            <p> Reports at the headquarters of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; 
              St. Louis Railway in this city indicate that the wreck was caused 
              by the engineer of the freight train pulling up and backing into 
              the switch instead of heading in, as is the rule of the road. The 
              freight was scheduled to meet the passenger train No. 3, which leaves 
              this city at 9:50 p.m., at Tullahoma, as was taking the switch when 
              the accident occurred. The siding is some distance this side of 
              the station, but within the station limits.</p>
            <p> The accident is one of those unexplained ones which often occur 
              and will never be explained,but it is supposed that the engineer 
              on the freight took it for granted that on account of the long stretch 
              of straight track just this side of the station, he could be seen 
              by the passenger engineer. But on account of the difficulty of telling 
              on a straight track whether a train is moving or standing still 
              he misjudged his distance and was struck before he could get his 
              whole train into the siding. All the train but the engine and three 
              cars had entered the switch when the passenger train, coming at 
              a fast rate, struck head on, ditching the freight engine and three 
              cars and derailing several cars of the passenger train.</p>
            <p> The passenger suffered practically no smashing, only the break, 
              besides the slight damage done the front of the engine, being the 
              breaking out of one of the drawerheads on one of the baggage cars.</p>
            <p> <strong>Trusted Employees.</strong></p>
            <p> The four employees who were killed were among the most trusted 
              on the road. Joe B. Sugg, engineer of the freight train, was a veteran 
              railroader and had been in the employ of the road for many years. 
              He and his son, H. J. Sugg, fireman on the passenger, who was also 
              killed, lived at 110 Fifteenth avenue, North. His wife and one son 
              and two daughters survive him.</p>
            <p> W. J. Ray, who was engineer of the passenger train,lived at 208 
              Fourteenth ave, North (Hardee street), and leaves a wife and several 
              small children. John Burrows, who was the negro porter on the passenger 
              train, was one of the most faithful servants in the service of the 
              road. He was for some years the personal porter of Mr. M. J. C. 
              Wrenne, Superintendent of Transportation of the Nashville, Chattanooga 
              &amp; St. Louis Railway, and in every capacity where he has served 
              has shown himself to be respectful and competent.</p>
            <p> L. M. Muse, express messenger, who was quite seriously hurt in 
              the collision at Murfreesboro some weeks ago, was at first reported 
              to be very seriously if not fatally hurt, but a later report says 
              that Dr. Eve has examined him and finds his condition to be not 
              so serious as at first thought. The old bruises and sprains which 
              he received in the Murfreesboro wreck were hurt over again, and 
              this, of course, causes him great pain. E. L. Grubbs, fireman of 
              the freight, escaped injury.</p>
            <p> <strong>Tracks Cleared.</strong></p>
            <p> The tracks were cleared at about 9:15 this morning, and traffic 
              has been resumed as usual. The Chicago and Florida Limited passed 
              through here about two hours late, and was delayed this side of 
              Tullahoma until the track was cleared. The north-bound limited escaped 
              the wreck and came in on time. Several of the railroad officials 
              went from here to the scene of the accident in order to straighten 
              out the trains and expedite the work of clearing away the debris. 
              To the special relief train which tached the private car of General 
              Manager John W. Thomas, Jr., who came in off the Northwestern Division 
              early this morning. Supt. J. H. Peebles was also in the train which 
              carried Dr. Paul Eve and several nurses.</p>
            <p> The reputation of the road for safety was maintained in that none 
              of the passengers received any injuries to amount to anything.</p>
