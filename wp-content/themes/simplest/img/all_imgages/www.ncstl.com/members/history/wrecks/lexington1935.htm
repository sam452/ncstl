              REPORT OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY CONCERNING AN ACCIDENT ON THE NASHVILLE,
              CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST. LOUIS RAILWAY AT LEXINGTON, TENN., ON FEBRUARY
              23, 1935.<br>
              <br>
              April 18, 1935.<br>
              <br>
              To the Commission:<br>
              <br>
              On February 23, 1935, there was a collision between a passenger
              train and a mixed train on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St.
              Louis Railway at Lexington, Tenn., which resulted in the injury
              of 5 passengers, 2 employees and 1 porter.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Location and method of operation</strong><br>
              <br>
              This accident occurred on that part of the Paducah and Memphis
              Division extending between Bruceton and Memphis, Tenn., a distance
              of 143.37 miles; in the vicinity of the point of accident this
              is a single-track line over which trains are operated by time table
              and train orders, no block-signal system being in use. There is
              a cross-over at Lexington which connects the main track with passing
              track, and the collision occurred on the passing track at a point
              4.6 feet south of the south switch of the cross-over or 146 feet
              north of the center line of the depot. The switch involved in the
              accident was the north cross-over switch, a facing-point switch
              for south-bound trains. Approaching the cross-over from the north,
              there is a 3 degrees curve to the right 881 feet in length, followed
              by 790 feet of tangent to the north cross-over switch and for a
              considerable distance beyond that point. The grade is 0.486 percent
              ascending to within 175 feet of the north switch of the cross-over,
              and then it is 0.49 percent descending to and beyond the switch.<br>
              <br>
              The passing track and various yard tracks parallel the main track
              on the east, and the Perryville Branch serves as a load track to
              the yard tracks; it leads off the Paducah and Memphis Division
              main track toward the northeast, the junction switch being a trailing-point
              switch for south-bound trains and being located 15.7 feet north
              of the north switch of the cross-over. The scale track is a continuation
              of the passing track and connects with the Perryville Branch. The
              switch stand of the north switch of the cross-over is of the New
              Century low type and is located on the west side of the main track;
              it is not equipped with targets but has a switch lamp, the top
              of which is 28 inches about the head block. The switch stand of
              the junction switch of the Perryville Branch is located on the
              east side of the main track and is equipped with large targets
              about 6 feet above the head block, as is also the house-track switch
              stand, located on the west side of the main track and 182 feet
              north of the junction switch. The depot, sand house and coal chute
              are located on the west side of the main line track; the sand house
              and coal chute being 250 feet and 375 feet, respectively, north
              of the north switch of the cross-over.<br>

              With the sun shining brightly, as was the case at the time of the
              accident, the indication displayed by the switch lamp of the north
              cross-over switch can not be seen and under such conditions the
              members of the engine crew of a south-bound train can determine
              the position of the switch only by seeing the switch points.<br>
              <br>
              The weather was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred
              about 11:59 a.m.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Description</strong><br>
              <br>
              Train No. 231, a north-bound mixed train on the Perryville Branch,
              originates at Lexington at 12:01 p.m. It has been made up and consisted
              of engine 375, two freight cars, and a wooden coach, in the order
              named, and was in charge of Conductor Dennison and Engineman Lindenfield.
              It was standing on the passing track with the front end of the
              engine immediately south of the cross-over. About 2 minutes before
              its schedule departing time, Train No. 104 entered the north switch
              of the cross-over, which was open, and then ran through the south
              cross-over switch and struck the branch line train.<br>
              <br>
              Train No. 104, a south-bound passenger train on the Paducah and
              Memphis Division main line, consisted of 1 baggage-mail car, 1
              baggage car, 2 coaches, and 1 cafe-coach, in the order names, hauled
              by engine 506, and was in charge of Conductor Hall and Engineman
              Herring. The cars were of all-steel construction with the exception
              of the second car, which was of steel-underframe construction.
              This train left Bruceton, 32.18 miles north of Lexington, at 10:45
              a.m., according to the train sheet, on them, and on reaching Lexington
              it entered the north cross-over switch and collided with Train
              No. 231 while traveling at a speed estimated to have been between
              15 and 25 miles per hour.<br>
              <br>
              Train No. 231 was driven backward a distance of about 50 feet and
              the front end of each engine was considerably damaged; the engine
              truck of engine 506 was demolished but none of the other equipment
              of this train was derailed or damaged. The employees injured were
              the conductor and fireman of Train No. 104.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Summary of evidence</strong><br>
              <br>
              Brakeman Garvey, of Train No. 231, who was a qualified conductor,
              stated that he had been on this particular run for about 13 years.
              He said that station switching and work of making up the train
              was performed between the hours of 9:30 and 11:15 a.m. During the
              course of this switching a car of coal was placed on the branch
              lead, following which the engine ran around it by backing through
              the scale track and then heading north through the cross-over and
              coupling to the car about 9:45 Brakeman Garvey said that he handled
              the north cross-over switch and the junction switch while this
              move was made and that this was the only time the north cross-over
              switch was opened. He then closed that switch and about 10:50 a.m.
              he returned to it and locked it, saying that the engine made several
              moves over this switch on the main track both before and after
              he locked it and then finally backed through the scale track and
              coupled to its train on the passing track at about 11:15 a.m.,
              where it remained until the accident occurred. At the time he locked
              the switch he snapped the lock and pulled on the chain, also observing
              that the switch points fitted properly. After the engine was finally
              coupled to the train he went home to lunch and was gone about 20
              or 25 minutes. On his return to the depot, about 11:35 a.m., he
              walked by the switch but did not observe its position, but immediately
              after the accident he saw that it was lined for the cross-over
              and locked. Brakeman Garvey further stated that he last observed
              the position of the switch about 20 minutes after he had locked
              it, or at the time he finally closed and locked the junction switch,
              about 11:10 a.m., at which time he looked at the crossover switch
              and saw that it was lined for the main track, although he did not
              notice whether or not it was locked at that time because he knew
              that he had already locked it; he did not think that he became
              confused as to the position of the switch and inadvertently opened
              it and locked it in that position.<br>
              <br>
              Brakeman Hodges, of Train No. 231, stated that the only time the
              north cross-over switch was opened was at the time the engine ran
              around the car of coal and he said he saw Brakeman Garvey line
              the switch back for the main track and put the lock in the hasp,
              but that he did not lock it. About 10:30 a.m. Train No. 105, a
              north-bound passenger train, passed over the switch on the main
              track, and Brakeman Hodges said that about 10:50 a.m. he saw Brakeman
              Garvey lock switch and that it then was lined for the main track.
              Brakeman Hodges also went home for lunch after his train was finally
              made up, which was about 11:17 a.m., and on his way home he crossed
              the main track at a point about one and one-half rail lengths south
              of the switch and saw that it was lined for the main track and
              locked. Brakeman Hodges said that he had not personally handled
              the north cross-over switch at any time nor did he see any one
              handle it except Brakeman Garvey.<br>
              <br>
              Conductor Dennison, of Train No. 231, stated that while the switching
              was being performed he was engaged with other duties. He went to
              the coal chute about 11:05 a.m. and told Brakeman Garvey that he
              was going home to eat, while on his way to the coal chute he had
              locked at the north cross-over switch and saw that it was lined
              for the main tack with the lock in the hasp; it looked as if the
              lock was shut, although he did not pull on the chain to ascertain
              whether it actually was locked. On his return from lunch, about
              11:25 a.m., he walked right over the switch and he sated that it
              then was lined for the main track and locked; he was unable to
              account for the switch being open at the time of the accident.<br>
              <br>
              Statements of Engineman Lindenfield and Fireman Attaway, of Train
              No. 231, were to the effect that the switch was used only once
              during the course of switching, this being while running the engine
              around the car of coal.<br>
              <br>
              Engineman Herring, of Train No. 104, stated that when about 3,200
              feet north of the cross-over the speed of his train was about 45
              miles per hour and he made a service application of the brakes,
              reducing the speed to about 30 or 35 miles per hour. While rounding
              the curve approaching the station he was looking for the indication
              displayed by the train-order signal, and on reaching a point about
              400 feet north of the north cross-over switch the fireman called
              the indication displayed by the train-order signal. Engineman Herring
              said he was prepared to make the regular station stop and that
              he continued to look for the train-order signal; when about opposite
              the sand house he saw the signal, then glanced ahead and saw the
              target of the house-track switch, located 198 feet north of the
              north cross-over switch, following which the fireman jumped off
              his seat box and ran over and shoved the brake-valve handle into
              emergency position and called &quot;open switch&quot;, at which
              time the speed was about 25 or 30 miles per hour with the engine
              working a drifting throttle. The engine entered the open north
              cross-over switch, ran through the south cross-over switch, and
              struck Train No. 231 while traveling at a speed of about 15 to
              18 miles per hour<br>
              <br>
              Engineman Herring was of the opinion that the open switch points
              were seen as soon as it was possible to have done so under the
              existing conditions, saying that with the sun shining brightly
              the view of the indication displayed by the switch lamp was rendered
              negligible, the view being interfered with also by the fact that
              the switch was located just beyond the apex of the grade and in
              proximity to other switches. Fireman Turner was seriously injured
              as a result of the accident and was not interviewed.<br>
              <br>
              Section Foreman Bray stated that the switch stand in question always
              had been equipped with a lamp en which a disc target was built
              around each lens, known as a day-target lamp. During switching
              operations, however, the targets were knocked off and the lenses
              broken out, and in the latter part of November, 1934, he ordered
              a main-line switch lamp for this stand; on December 18, 1934, he
              received a straight lamp, designed for a switch already equipped
              with a target, and placed it on the switch stand without notifying
              the supervisor that he was using a plain lamp, without targets,
              on a main-line switch. The section foreman also said that the junction
              switch; which is equipped, with a high target stand located on
              the east side of the track, was just north of the north cross-over
              switch and in order to keep the two stands from being in line with
              each other, the stand of the cross-over switch was placed between
              the main track and house track, and on account of the clearance
              between these tracks a high target stand could not be used as a
              matter of safety to employees riding on the sides of cars during
              switching operations.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Discussion</strong><br>
              <br>
              According to the evidence the north cross-over switch was used
              only once during the switching performed by the crew of Train No.
              231 and that was at about, 9:45 a.m., when Brakeman Garvey opened
              it to permit his engine to head through the cross-over in order
              to run around a car, and he said that he then closed the switch
              and placed the lock in the hasp but did not lock it. About 10:30
              a.m. Train No. 105, a north-bound passenger train passed over the
              switch while it was unlocked and Brakeman Garvey said that at about
              10:50 a.m. he walked over to the switch and snapped the lock and
              pulled on the chain and that at about 11:10 a.m. he looked at the
              switch as he passed it and saw that it was closed. Brakeman Hodges
              verified these statements by saying he saw Brakeman Garvey close
              the switch and latter on saw him lock it, while Conductor Dennison
              observed the position of the switch on his return from lunch at
              11:25 a.m. and saw that it was closed at that time. Immediately
              after the accident the switch was found to be line for the cross-over
              and locked, and it was not damaged, indicating that it had been
              opened after the passage of Train No. 105 at 10:30 a.m. Employees
              were in the vicinity practically continuously up to the time of
              the accident, but so far as could be determined no one touched
              the switch except Brakeman Garvey and he said he did not think
              that he became confused at any time as to the position of the switch
              and inadvertently changed it from the main track to the cross-over
              and locked it in that position; however, the investigation did
              not reveal any other possible explanation for the switch being
              open.<br>
              <br>
              Engineman Herring, of Train No. 104, was looking for the train-order
              signal and then glanced at the house-track switch target, and about
              this time his fireman ran across to his side of the engine, shoved
              the brake-valve handle into emergency position, and called &quot;open
              switch&quot;; the engineman also said that the indication displayed
              by the switch lamp was practically obscured when the sun was shining,
              in fact, observations showed that the position of the switch, just
              over the apex of a grade, could first be ascertained by observing
              the switch points. There was no target on the switch stand, the
              section foreman saying that he had asked for a new main-line switch
              lamp and received a lamp designed for a stand already equipped
              with targets, instead of a lamp with a disc target surrounding
              each lens,<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
              <br>
              This accident was caused by an open switch.<br>
              <br>
              It is recommended that the carrier make such changes as may be
              necessary in order to permit of the installation of a switch stand
              which will be adequate to afford a proper indication of the position
              of the position of the switch to a train approaching from either
