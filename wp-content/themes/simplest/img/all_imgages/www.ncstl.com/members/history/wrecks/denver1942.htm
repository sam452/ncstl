              PATTERSON, Commissioner:</p>
            <p>              On March 15, 1942, there was a head-end collision between a passenger
              train and a freight train on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St.
              Louis Railway near Denver, Tenn., which resulted in the death of
              5 train-service employees and the injury of 27 passengers, 1 Pullman
              employee, 6 employees off duty arid 1 train-service employee on
            duty.</p>
            <p><strong>              <img src="images/denver.jpg" width="671" height="937"></strong></p>
            <p align="center">              Inv. No. 2577 N. C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Denver, Tenn. March 15, 1942</p>
            <p>              <strong>Location of Accident and Method of Operation</strong></p>
            <p>              This accident occurred on that part of the Nashville Division which
              extends between Bruceton and Nashville, Tenn., a distance or 94.87
              miles. In the vicinity or the point of accident this is a single-track
              line over which trains are operated by timetable and train orders.
              There is no block system in use. At Denver siding 1,996 feet in
              length parallels the main track on the east. The south switch of
              this siding is 213 feet south of the station. The accident occurred
              at a point 3,271 feet south of the south siding-switch. As the
              point of accident is approached from the north there is a tangent
              1.39 miles in length, which is followed by a compound curve to
              the left 1,847 feet in length, the curvature of which varies from
              3 degrees 27 to 4 degrees 30. The accident occurred on this curve
              at a point 1,364 feet south of its northern end where the curvature
              is 4 degree 30. As the point of accident is approached from the
              south there are in succession, a 2 degree curve to the left 925
              feet in length, a tangent 787 feet, and the curve on which the
              accident occurred. At the point of accident the grade is 0.032
              percent ascending northward. In the vicinity of the point of accident
              the track is laid on a hillside cut.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Operating rules read in part as follows:</strong></p>
            <p>              204. Train orders must be addressed to those who are to execute
              them, naming the place at which each is to receive his copy. Those
              for a train must be addressed to the conductor and engineman, and
              also to any one who acts as its pilot. A copy for each person addressed
              must be supplied by the operator.</p>
            <p>              * * *</p>
            <p>              205. Each train order must be written in full in a book provided
              for the purpose at the office of the train dispatcher; and with
              it recorded the names of those who have signed for the order; the
              time and the signals which show when end from what offices the
              order was repeated; the responses transmitted, and the train dispatchers
              initials. These records must he made at once, and never from memory
              or memoranda.              </p>
            <p>208. A train order to be sent to two or more offices must be transmitted
              simultaneously to as many of them as practicable.</p>
            <p>              The several addresses must be in the order of superiority of trains
              end when practicable must include the operator at the meeting or
              Waiting point, each office taking its proper address.</p>
            <p>              * * *</p>
            <p>              210.	When a &quot;31&quot; train order has been transmitted, *
              * *. Each operator receiving the order should observe whether the
              others repeat correctly.<br>
            </p>
            <p>* * *</p>
            <p>              434.	* * *<br>
              Each figure and word of a train order must be written or underscored
                while it is being repeated.<br>

            <p>              On the curve involved the maximum authorized speed for passenger
              trains is 45 miles per hour, and for freight 35 miles per hour.</p>
            <p>              Extra 606 North, a north-bound freight train, consisted of engine
                606, 29 loaded cars and 1 empty car and a caboose. At Nashville,
                75.12. miles south of Denver, a terminal air-brake test was made
                and the brakes functioned properly. At Colesburg, 35.5 miles
                  south of Denver, the crew received a clearance card together
                  with copies
              of train order No. 14, Form 19, which read as follows:</p>
            <p>              Ex 606 North meet No. 1 Eng 507 at Denver First No 55 Eng 601
                  at Johnsonville and has right over Second No 55 Colesburg to
                  Bruceton</p>
            <p>              Extra 606 departed from Colesburg 3:20 a.m., according to the
                  dispatchers record of movement of trains, passed McEwen, 17.95
                  miles south
                of Denver and the last open office, at 3:54 a.m., and while moving
                at an estimate speed of 25 to 30 miles per hour it collided with
                No. 1 at a paint about 0.6 mile south of the south siding-switch
              at Denver.</p>
            <p>              No. 1, a south-bound first-class passenger train, consisted of
                engine 507, 1 express car, 1 baggage car, 1 mail car, 1 passenger-baggage
                car, 1 coach, 2 Pullman sleeping cars, 1 coach end 1 business
                  car, in the order named. All cars were of steel construction
                  except
                the rear car, which was of wooden construction. At Bruceton,
                  19.75 miles north of Denver, the crew received copies of a
                  clearance
                together with copies of three train orders not involved in this
                accident. After a terminal air-brake test was completed this
                  train departed from Bruceton at 3:53 a.m. according to the
                  dispatchers
                record of movement of trains, 13 minutes late. Soon after it
                  departed from Bruceton a running test was made, and the brakes
                  functioned
                properly at all points where used en route. This train passed
                  Johnsonville, 2.6 miles north or Denver and the last open office,
                  at 4:22 a.m.,
                9 minutes late, and while moving at an estimated speed of 35
                  to 50 miles per hour it collided with Extra 606 North.</p>
            <p>              Because of track curvature and a growth of trees on the east
                  side of the curve, the view of the point of accident from the
                  left side
                of a south-bound engine is restricted to a distance of 1,372
                  feet, and from the right side of a north-bound engine, 1,271
                  feet.</p>
            <p>              The boiler of engine 507, of No. 1, was torn from its frame and
                stopped bottom up, down the embankment to the east, at an angle
                of 45 degrees to the track and 30 feet from it. The frame and
                  the driving-wheel assembly stopped at the rear of the boiler.
                  The cab
                was torn off. The tender was derailed and demolished. The first
                and second cars were destroyed. The third car stopped down the
                embankment to the west and was badly damaged. The front truck
                  of the fourth car was derailed. The boiler of engine 606 was
                  torn
                from the frame and stopped, bottom up, down the embankment, at
                right eagles to the track and near the frame of engine 507. The
                driving-wheel assembly and frame remained upright on the roadbed.
                The cab was torn off. The tender was derailed and stopped down
                the embankment, 37 feet horizontally distant from the track.
                  The first seven cars were demolished. The wreckage of both
                  trains was
              contained within a distance of 160 feet.</p>
            <p>              It was cloudy at the time of the accident, which occurred about
              4:35 a.m.</p>
            <p>              The employees killed were the engineer, the fireman and the front
                brakeman of Extra 606 North, and the fireman of No. 1 man of
                  No. 1 and a student fireman who was on the engine. The employee
                  injured
              was the engineer of No. 1.</p>
            <p><strong>              Data</strong></p>
            <p>              During the 30-day period proceeding the day of the accident,
                  the average daily movement in the vicinity of the point of
                  accident
              was 24.5 trains.</p>
            <p><strong>              Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>              The operating rules on the line involved require that train orders
                must be addressed to those who are to execute them. Train orders
                intended for a train must be addressed to the conductor and the
                engineer of that train. At the time of transmittal the train
                  dispatcher is required to write train, orders in full in a
                  book provided for
                that purpose. Operators receiving an order must write it on the
                prescribed form during transmission and must then repeat it to
                the dispatcher. Tile time and the signals which show the time
                  of repetition and the offices from which the order is repeated,
                  the
                names of those who have signed for the order and for the order
                and the responses must be recorded in the train-order book. The
                records in the train-order book must be made at once and never
                from memory or memoranda. The dispatcher, the student dispatcher
                who transmitted the order and the three operators who handled
                  the order involved in this accident understood these requirements.</p>
            <p>              The investigation disclosed that a student dispatcher was transmitting
                orders under the supervision of the regularly assigned dispatcher.
                Train order No. 14 was transmitted to Bruceton on Form 31 for
                  First and Second 55, to Colesburg on Form 19 for Extra 606
                  North, and
                to Johnsonville on Form 19 for the operator. Among other provisions
                this order established a meeting point between No. 1, a south-bound
                first-class train, and Extra 606, a north-bound freight train,
                at Denver, a blind aiding. Extra 606 was required to enter the
                siding at Denver. According to the statement of the student dispatcher,
                he addressed the order to First and Second 55, south-bound third-class
                trains, at Bruceton, but forgot to address the order to No. 1
                  at Bruceton and, curing the repetition, failed to discover
                  the omission.
                The regular dispatcher and listened both to the transmission
                  of the order and to its repetition. The office was equipped
                  with a
                loud-speaker by which the repetition could be heard plainly.
                  The operator at Johnsonville, who held the middle order, the
                  operator
                at Bruceton and the operator at Colesburg repeated in the order
                named. Each listened to the repetition of the others but none
                  discovered that the copy held by the operator at Bruceton lacked
                  an address
                to No. 1. The order was made complete at 3:18 a.m. and the regular
                dispatcher checked the order in the train-order book but failed
                to discover that it was not addressed to No. 1. According to
                  the statement of the operator at Bruceton, as order No. 14
                  was not
                addressed to No. 1, he did not deliver copies of that order to
                the conductor and the engineer; however, he delivered copies
                  of three other orders to that train. Of these orders, two were
                  speed-restriction
                orders on Form 19, and the other, on Form 31, established a meeting
                point between No. 1 and No. 54, a north-bound third-class train,
                at Gormen, 14.3 miles south of Denver. The Form 11 orders which
                required the signature of the conductor No. 1, was made complete
                at 3:40 a.m. Had train order No. 14 been properly addressed,
                  the conductor of No 1 would have been required to sign it.
                  When the
                operator at Bruceton transmitted the signature of the conductor
                of No. 1 on the one Form 31 order, the student dispatcher and
                  the assigned dispatcher again failed to discover that order
                  No. 14
                had not been addressed to No. 1. Since Bruceton was the initial
                station of the schedule of No. 1, the operator could not have
                  assumed that No. 1 would receive copies of order No. 14 at
                  some point before
                it reached Bruceton, end he knew that the order was not addressed
                to No. 1 at any point south of Bruceton. At the time of the accident,
                this employee had worked as an operator less than 3 months. The
                regular dispatcher was employed as operator in 1917, and was
                  promoted to dispatcher in 1927. The student dispatcher was
                  employed as operator
                in October, 1940. On October 9, 1941, he was authorized to become
                a student dispatcher. Throughout the period of instruction he
                  had always transmitted orders under direct supervision of a
                  qualified
              dispatcher.</p>
            <p>              The operators at Colesburg and Johnsonville heard the operator
                at Bruceton repeat the body of the order involved but did not
                  hear him repeat the forepart of the Order.</p>
            <p>              The operator at Johnsonville said that as No. 1 was approaching
                his station the train-order signal displayed stop. He informed
                the dispatcher of the approach of No. 1 and was instructed to
                  clear the train-order signal.</p>
            <p>              Under train order No. 14, Extra 606 North was authorized to use
                the main track as far as the south siding-switch at Denver. Because
                of its superiority being unrestricted, No. 1 had authority to
                  use the main track south of the south siding-switch; therefore,
                  this
                resulted in a lap of authority between opposing trains and as
                  a result of this lap these trains collided south of the south
                  siding-switch.</p>
            <p>              According to the statement of the engineer of No. 1, as his train
                was approaching the point where the accident occurred the speed
                was 35 to 40 miles per hour, the headlight was lighted brightly
                and he was maintaining a lookout ahead. The regular fireman was
                tending the fire and a student fireman was on the left seatbox.
                Because of the curvature to the right, the engineer was not aware
                that anything was wrong until his train collided with Extra 606
                North. Apparently the student fireman did not see the opposing
                train as he gave no warning. Since all members of the crew on
                  the engine of Extra 606 were killed in the accident it could
                  not be
                determined when they first became aware of the approach of No.
                1. According to the statements of the conductor and the flagman
                of Extra 606, as their train was approaching the point where
                  the accident occurred the speed was about 25 or 30 miles per
                  hour.
                The first they know of anything being wrong was when the brakes
                were applied in emergency just before the collision occurred.<br>
              In the territory involved trains are operated by timetable and
                train orders only. If an adequate block system has been in use
              on this territory, this accident would have been averted.</p>
            <p><strong>              Cause</strong></p>
            <p>              It is found that this accident was caused by failure to address
              a restricting order to the superior train.</p>
            <p><strong>              Recommendation</strong></p>
            <p>              It is recommended that the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis
              Railway Company establish an adequate block system on the line
            involved in this accident.</p>
