              In re investigation of an accident which occurred on the Nashville, 
              Chattancoga &amp; St. Louis Railway near Atlanta, Ga., on September 
              26, 1917.</p>
            <p>October 31, 1917.</p>
            <p>On September 26, 1917, there was a rear-end collision between a 
              freight train and a freight transfer on the Nashville, Chattanooga 
              &amp; St. Louis Railway near Atlanta, Ga., resulted in the injury 
              of eight employees. After investigation of this accident the Chief 
              of the Bureau of Safety reports as follows:</p>
            <p>This collision occurred within the yard limits of the Atlanta Terminal, 
              on the Atlanta Division of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. 
              Louis Railway, which yard extends between Atlanta and Bolton, a 
              distance of 6.88 miles. The general course of the Atlanta Division 
              is north and south, but in the vicinity of the accident the line 
              of track is such that southbound trains run in an easterly direction 
              and northbound trains, correspondingly, in a westerly direction; 
              train movements over this division are governed by timetable and 
              train orders.</p>
            <p>At Howell, about 3 miles north of Atlanta station, the tracks of 
              the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway cross over those 
              of the Southern Railway Belt Line at grade, crossover movements 
              being controlled by an interlocking plant operated from tower No. 
              1, located at the crossing, 1,250 feet west of which the collision 
              occurred. The home interlocking signal for southbound trains is 
              located 475 feet west of the crossing and the distant signal is 
              about 2,000 feet west of the home signal.</p>
            <p>Southbound freight transfer, on route to the transfer point of 
              this railway with the Central of Georgia Railway, consisting of 
              20 loaded cars being pushed ahead of switching locomotive 420, was 
              in charge of Engine Foreman Halma and Engineman Lanier. It left 
              the yard at Hills Park, which place is 2.43 miles from Bowell, at 
              10.21 p. m. The distant signal for the crossing at tower No. 1 was 
              in the caution position, and the transfer proceeded to within about 
              a car length of the home signal, which was in the stop, about 10.28 
              p.m. After two or three minutes, upon the signal having been cleared, 
              the transfer started froward and had moved several car lengths when 
              it was struck from the rear by train No. 23.</p>
            <p>Southbound local freight train No. 23, drawn by locomotive 399, 
              was in charge of Conductor Matthews and Engineman Jones, and left 
              Dalton, Ga., 99 miles north of Atlanta, at 8:40 a. m. At Kennesaw, 
              28.64 miles from Atlanta, the conductor received instructions from 
              the Atlanta, the conductor received instructions from the chief 
              dispatcher to bring his train to Magnolia Street, Atlanta, if possible 
              to do so within the 16-hour service limit, which expired for this 
              crew at 10:50 p. m. Train No. 23 passed Bolton at 10:27 p. m., and 
              at 10:32 or 1033 p. m. collided with locomotive 420, while travelling 
              at a speed of about 25 miles an hour. At the time of accident there 
              were five loaded cars and a caboose in train No. 23.</p>
            <p>The point of collision was on a 5-degree 46-minute curve to the 
              left, 700 feet long, about 275 feet beyond its western end. this 
              curve is followed by a 6-degree curve to the right, 600 feet in 
              length, which in turn is followed by 250 feet of tangent track to 
              tower No. 1. Approaching the curve on which the accident occurred 
              from the yard at Mills Park there is an almost unbroken series of 
              curves ranging from 2 degrees to 5 degrees 46 minutes. the collision 
              occurred on a long grade approximating one-half of one per sent, 
              ascending for southbound trains. Beginning 850 feet west of the 
              point of collision and continuing to a point 550 feet east of it, 
              there is a cut varying in depth from 25 to 50 feet.</p>
            <p>Locomotive 399 was slightly damaged, it being the only part of 
              train No. 23 to sustain damage. The tender of locomotive 420, which 
              was the part struck by train No. 23, was forced into the gangway 
              of the engine, destroying the engine cob; the rear end of the tender 
              was derailed. As a result of the collision of oil headlight on locomotive 
              420 exploded; the car ahead of it was ignited thereby and destroyed. 
              At the time of the accident the weather was clear.</p>
            <p>The timetable in effect on the Atlanta Division contains special 
              instructions governing main line speed regulations as follows:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&quot;Between Atlanta and Bolton all trains must run so as to 
                be able to stop within range of vision. Train orders will not 
                be required between these points.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Switchman Mangum, of the transfer, stated that trains on which 
              he has ridden have often stopped is the cut where the accident occurred 
              and always been protested by flag; and that in this instance, about 
              15 seconds after the train came to a stop, he got down off the south 
              and of the car next to the engine and started back to flag. He said 
              that when he reached the tender he looked back but did not see anything 
              of an approaching train; he then turned and saw a proceed signal 
              being given by the middle brakeman, returned to the car next to 
              the engine and gave the engineman a proceed signal, and the train 
              started forward about two minutes about having come to a stop. He 
              said it had moved about 4 car lengths when train No. 23 collided 
              with it. Switchman Mangum stated that he remembered a bulletin instructing 
              men to use great care in flagging and mentioning the cut in which 
              the accident occurred as begin sons of the most dangerous points 
              on the division.</p>
            <p>Engine Foreman *** of the transfer, stated that he had seen bulletins 
              instructing that trains be protected by flag in the cut; and that, 
              while not positive, he believed that Switchman Mangum started back 
              to flag when the transfer stopped near the Southern Railway crossing.</p>
            <p>Engineman Lanier, of the transfer, stated that when it came to 
              a stop near the Southern Railway crossing he saw the switches on 
              the car is front of the locomotive cross over to the left side of 
              the car, out of sight, but that he was not gone more then a minute 
              and a half before he returned and gave him a proceed signal. He 
              stated that the transfer was not delayed more than 2 minutes, and 
              that after it had proceeded one or two car lengths he saw a flash 
              of light, his first intimation of the approach of train No. 23, 
              just before the collision occurred. He stated that as a rule when 
              trains of which he was engineman same to a stop at this crossing 
              he whistled out a flagman, but did not do so on this occasion, because 
              of other duties.</p>
            <p>Engineman Jones, of train No. 23, stated that, while not compelled 
              to take the train to Megnolia Street, other trains had been placed 
              on sidings for his train, and he therefore felt it was desired of 
              his and was his duty to do go. He stated that he was familiar with 
              the rule requiring trains to be run between Bolton and Atlanta prepared 
              to stop within range of vision; that his train was travelling at 
              too great a speed within yard limits, but that this was done because 
              he was endeavouring to reach Magnolia Street before exceeding the 
              16-hour period an duty. He said that until near the distant signal 
              for the Southern Railway crossing the speed was about 25 miles an 
              hour; that he was within 6 or 7 car lengths of locomotive 420 when 
              he first saw it; that the speed of his train was then 10 or 12 miles 
              an hour; and that he at once applied the brakes in emergency, but 
              the intervening distance was too short to permit of the train being 
              stopped before colliding with locomotive 420. He said that the proper 
              speed, in the interest of safety, would have been about 6 miles 
              an hour in the vicinity of the accident. Engineman Jones stated 
              that he had nor previously found southbound trains standing there, 
              but expected that if any train was standing on the track ahead of 
              his train if would be protected by flag.</p>
            <p>Conductor Matthews, of train No. 23, stated that his train passed 
              Bolton at 10:27 p. m.; that the distant signal for the Southern 
              Railway crossing was in the caution position, the steam was shut 
              off and the train was drifting as it approached the point of accident, 
              and he considered the speed as being sufficiently under control 
              to stop at the crossing. He stated that he was riding in the couple 
              of the caboose when he first saw locomotive 420, that the brakes 
              were applied in emergency, and that the speed was 20 or 25 miles 
              an hour when the collision occurred, at 10:33 p. m. Conductor Matthews 
              stated that he was familiar with the rules governing train movements 
              between Melton and Atlanta, according to which his train should 
              have been so run as to admit of its being stopped within range of 
              vision. He said that his engineman could set see locomotive 420 
              until within 6 or 8 car lengths of it, and that the light on the 
              rear of that locomotive was burning. Conductor Matthews stated that 
              the speed of his train was 30 or 35 miles an hour as it passed Bolton 
              and proceeded through the yard. He said that it was not customary 
              for his train to he operated within yard limits at so great a speed, 
              which he realized to be excessive, but he did not take any steps 
              to have it reduced because an effort was being made to reach Magnolia 
              Street before the expiration of the 16-hour period on duty, as a 
              message had been received at Kennesaw to do so if possible, and 
              because he thought the engineman knew what he was doing; he though 
              it was against the rules to apply the brakes from the caboose except 
              in case of emergency. He said that the air brakes on all the cars 
              in his train were operating properly.</p>
            <p>Fireman Morgan, of train No. 23, stated that between Bolton and 
              the point of accident the speed of his train was consistently about 
              25 or 30 miles an hour; that he know that between Bolton and Atlanta 
              trains were to be run so as to be able to stop within range of vision, 
              and that therefore the speed should not have been more than 4 or 
              5 miles an hour is the cut where the accident occurred. He stated, 
              however, that they were trying to reach Magnolie Street before being 
              on duty more than 16 consecutive hours, as the conductor had received 
              a message to bring the train in if possible, but that that did not 
              justify the violation of rules by running at too great a speed, 
              and that they could have tied up at Hills Part, as had been done 
              on previous occasions.</p>
            <p>Flagman Jackson, of train No. 23, stated that he was riding in 
              the caboose approaching the point of accident; that the speed was 
              25 or 30 miles an hour and he remarked to the conductor that if 
              that speed were maintained they would hit something before reaching 
              Atlanta, but that in-as much as their 16-hour period on duty was 
              soon to expire the conductor did not make any effort to step the 
              train. He stated that while a message had been received at Kennesaw, 
              to bring the train to Atlanta if possible, there was no particular 
              reason why they could not have died up at Hills Park or Howell. 
              He said that in the vicinity of the accident the speed should not 
              have be a greater them 10 miles an hour in order to enable the train 
              to be stopped within range of vision.</p>
            <p>Brakeman Mashburn, of train No. 23, who was riding in the caboose, 
              stated that the speed was 25 or 30 miles an hour until the distant 
              signal for the Southern Railway crossing was reached, when it was 
              reduced to go or 25 miles on hour. Brakeman Melian, who was also 
              riding in the caboose, stated that in his opinion the speed was 
              35 or 40 miles an hour when his train passed Bolton, end about 30 
              miles an hour when the collision occurred.</p>
            <p>Terminal Trainmaster of McCord, of Atlanta, stated that within 
              yard limits all trains are required to run prepared to stop within 
              range of vision. He said that the cut in which the collision occurred 
              is one of the most dangerous places in the division, and that a 
              speed of more than 6 or 7 miles an hour would be unsafe there. He 
              said that he had at least verbally given special instructions that, 
              as an extra precaution, trains occupying the main tracks within 
              yard limits, is the vicinity of the yard at Hills Park end the cut 
              mentioned, should be protected by flag: he though he had else issued 
              written instructions to that effect, but he could find no copy thereof. 
              He stated that these instructions had been particularly impressed 
              upon the employees coming within the his jurisdiction and he found 
              that they were usually complied with, especially in the cut.</p>
            <p>According to the testimony of Conductor Matthew, train No. 23 passed 
              Bolton at 10:27 p. m. and collided with the transfer at 10:33 p. 
              m., having consumed &amp; minutes between the two points. The distance 
              is about 3-1/2 miles, and the speed therefore must have averaged 
              35 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>This accident was caused by train No. 23 being operated within 
              yard limits at too high a rate of speed to enable the engineman 
              to stop the train within range of vision, for which Engineman Jones 
              and Conductor Matthews were responsible. Both men knew that the 
              speed was too grade between 'Bolton and the point of collision, 
              the conductor stating that he did not take any steps to bring the 
              train to a step of have the speed reduced, as an effort was being 
              made to reach Magnelia Street before exceeding the 16-hour period 
              an duty, because he had received a message to do so if possible.</p>
            <p>Terminal Trainmaster McCord claimed that he had issued bulletins 
              instructing crews protect their trains by flag when occupying the 
              main tracks in the cut where the collision occurred, that being 
              one of the most dangerous point son the division. No copy of any 
              such bulletin could be found, but some of he crew of he transfer 
              involved in the collision admitted having seen such instructions. 
              Under date of May 17, 1912, a bulletin was issued ever the signature 
              of the superintendent, providing in part as follows:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&quot;All trains and yard engines will run so as to stop within 
                range of vision between Hills Park and Union Depot, Atlanta. This 
                does not reliance trains and engines from protecting as circumstances 
                may require.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The testimony of employees involved disclosed that it is customary 
              for flag protection to be afforded trains stopping in the cut near 
              the Southern Railway crossing, but in this instance the engineman 
              of the transfer did not whistle cut a flag, because of other duties. 
              The transfer was delayed only shut two minutes there, and during 
              that time Switchman Mangum had gotten down off the car next to the 
              engine and gone back as far as the tender when a signal was given 
              to proceed and be returned to the top of the car and transmitted 
              the proceed signal to the engineman.</p>
            <p>Engineman Jones served 4 years as a fireman on this railway and 
              32 years as an engineman. Conductor Matthews had been employed 29 
              years by this company, having been a conductor for 14 years. Both 
              employees had good records. At the time of accident the crew of 
              train No. 23 had been on duty 15 hours 45 minutes; and the crew 
              of the transfer had been on duty about 8 hours</p>
