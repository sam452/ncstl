            <p>IN RE INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE NASHVILLE 
              CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST. LOUIS RAILWAY NEAR VININGA, GEORGIA ON APRIL 
              18, 1918.</p>
            <p>June 10, 1918.</p>
            <p>On April 18, 1918, there was a derailment of a passenger train 
              on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway near Vininga, 
              Georgia, which resulted in the injury of 3 employees and 4 person 
              carried under contract. After investigation of this accident the 
              Chief of the Bureau of Safety submits the following report:</p>
            <p>The part of the Atlants Division on which this derailment occurred 
              is a single-track line, over which train movements are governed 
              by time-table and train orders, supplemented by a manual block signal 
              system. The time-table required that passenger trains reduce speed 
              to 46 miles per hour before entering upon and while rounding all 
              curved between Atlanta and Cartersville, in which territory the 
              accident occurred.</p>
            <p>Southbound passenger train No. 95, known as the Dixie Flyer, consisted 
              of 2 mail cars, 1 baggage car, 2 coaches, 1 dining car and 4 Pullman 
              sleeping cars, in the order named, was hauled by locomotive 506, 
              and was in charge of Conductor Offutt and Engineman Harris. It left 
              Chattanooga, Tenn. at 10.50 p.m., April 17th, 6 hours 35 minutes 
              late, passed Smyrna, Ga., 121.8 miles south of Chattanooga and 15 
              miles north of Atlanta, at 2.12 a.m., April 18, 6 hours 42 minutes 
              late, and at 2.21 p.m. it was derailed about 3.35 miles beyond Smyrna 
              or 1/2 mile north of Vinings, while running at a speed of about 
              40 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>The locomotive, tender and first mail car turned over on their 
              left sides, the locomotive coming to rest across the passing track, 
              which parallel the main track on the east; the tender came to rest 
              on the east side of the passing track, and the mail car partly down 
              the 75-feet embankment on the east side of the track. the second 
              mail car came to rest bottom upward across the passing track and 
              on the side of the embankment, at an angle of about 45 degrees with 
              the track. The body of the baggage car remained upright, with its 
              front end on the main track and the rear end scroes the passing 
              track. The first coach remained upright and came to rest across 
              both the main track and the passing track; the second coach also 
              remained upright, with its front end slightly to the right of the 
              main track. The dining car had its front end derailed to the left 
              of the main track but its road end remained on the track. None of 
              the Fullman sleeping cars was derailed.</p>
            <p>Approaching the point of accident from the north the track is tangent 
              for a distance of 1.141 feet, followed by a 5-degree 30-minute curve 
              to the right, 1,567 feet in length; the accident occurred on this 
              curve, about 260 feet from its northern end. There is a descending 
              grade varying from .17% to ***for southbound trains. The track is 
              laid with 80-pound rails 23 feet in length, double-spiked to 18 
              oak ties to the rail; tie plates are used on curves. The ballast 
              consists of stones and cinder, even with the tops of the ties, and 
              has a considerable shoulder. The track is somewhat irregular in 
              surface, but the alignment is good. At the time of the accident 
              the weather was cloudy.</p>
            <p>Engineman Harris, of train No. 95, stated that at Marietta, a station 
              9.3 miles north of Vininga, he received a slop order pertaining 
              to a bad place in the track near Campbells Crossing, 2 miles north 
              of the point of derailment. He stated that approaching the specified 
              piece of track he placed his throttle in the drifting position, 
              applied the brakes and reduced the speed to about 15 miles an hour; 
              that he did not change the throttle afterward; and that he did not 
              notice any rough spots approaching the point of accident. He said 
              that just prior to the derailment he saw sparks flying from the 
              track immediately applied the brakes in emergency, and the train 
              continued for about 700 feet before coming to a stop. Engineman 
              Harris said that his train consumed 9 minutes between Smyrna and 
              the point of accident, and that its speed was not more than 40 miles 
              in hour when derailed. He stated that his locomotive had not been 
              out of the shops long, that the wheels had not caused any trouble, 
              and that it rode better than did most locomotives. Engineman Harris 
              further stated that he considered the superelevation on curves as 
              being insufficient.</p>
            <p>Fireman Kemp stated that the locomotive rode well on this trip: 
              that the speed was reduced to 20 or 25 miles an hour at Campbells 
              Crossing; that he thought the train was drifting when passing through 
              Smyrna; that the engine throttle was not opened afterward, and that 
              the speed was 38 or 40 miles an hour when the derailment occurred. 
              He stated that he did not notice any rough spots in the track just 
              before the derailment occurred; and that when his train reached 
              the curve on which it was derailed he saw sparks flying, and the 
              engine truck left the rails.</p>
            <p>Conductor Offutt stated that when the derailment occurred he was 
              in the first Pullman sleeping car, and that he thought the speed 
              was not more than 40 miles an hour at the time.</p>
            <p>Flagman Scott stated that after the accident he went back to flag; 
              he did not see anything on the track., and considered it as being 
              in very good condition.</p>
            <p>Division Engineer Walker stated that on April 16th, two days prior 
              to the date of accident, he made an inspection in this vicinity, 
              but found no track sufficiently rough to impress him as being dangerous. 
              He further stated that the maximum superelevation on curves between 
              Cartersville and Atlanta is six inches, and he thought this was 
              sufficient provided the speed limits were observed. He said that 
              it has been impossible to secure all the track repairmen necessary, 
              as industries along the line offer higher wages and a great many 
              of the men have been drafted into military service.</p>
            <p>Section Foreman Bramlett, who since March 14th was in charge of 
              the section on which the train was derailed, stated that on the 
              evening before the derailment occurred he walked over the track, 
              paid close attention to it, and considered it as being in good condition. 
              He stated that on the morning of April 17th he found that the superelevation 
              on the curve was mainly six inches, with an increase of about half 
              an inch south of where the train was later derailed. He said that 
              this particular piece of track did not cause more trouble than any 
              other cinder ballasted portion of track, and that he considered 
              it good for a speed of 50 miles an hour. He also said that after 
              the accident he examined the track and found two joints a little 
              low on the inside rail of the curve, just north of where the engine 
              trucks mounted the rail. Section Foreman Bramlett stated that his 
              section consists of six miles of main track and two miles of siding; 
              that there was only one man beside himself on his gang; that he 
              was unable to get more men because of nearby industries paying better 
              wages; that he was not been able to lay any ties since taking charge, 
              or properly to maintain the track, with his present force; and that 
              no should have eight men all the time.</p>
            <p>Trackwalker Jones stated that when going over the track the day 
              before the accident, he did not see anything wrong with its where 
              train No. 95 was afterward derailed.</p>
            <p>Track Supervisor Riggs, in charge of the territory between Cartersville 
              and Atlanta, stated that on April 16th he accompanied an inspection 
              party over the track in the vicinity of the accident, that he found 
              the ties fairly good, and that while the track was slightly out 
              of surface and alignment it was not sufficiently so to cause derailment. 
              He stated that there was one joint about 24 feet north of where 
              the engine truck left the rails, which he found to be 5/8 inch low 
              when there was an engine on it, and it displayed evidence of a slight 
              churning; there were also two or three joints just north of the 
              one mentioned which were about 1/4 inch low, but he thought that 
              was not enough to cause any rocking motion of an engine. He said 
              that he did not consider any track in his territory as being unsafe, 
              but that it would become so within the next 90 days unless more 
              help was secured.</p>
            <p>Locomotive 506 was of the 4-6-2 type; the tender had a capacity 
              of 13-1/2 tons of coal and 8,000 gallons of water; the total weight 
              of engine and tender ready for service was 385,000 pounds. Investigation 
              disclosed nothing about the equipment that might have caused the 
              train to be derailed.</p>
            <p>The first mark of derailment, apparently made by the leading pair 
              of wheels on the engine truck, was found 262 feet in on the curve, 
              on a tie-plate outside the high rail of the curve. The ties were 
              slightly marked for a distance of 140 feet, the track then being 
              torn up for a distance of 350 feet. The testimony of the crew of 
              train No. 95 indicated that the speed of that train was only about 
              40 miles an hour when the derailment occurred; also, the schedule 
              running time of train No. 95 between Smyrna and Vinings is 6 minutes, 
              whereas on this trip 9 minutes were consumed between Smyrna and 
              the point of derailment, which was bout half a mile north of Vininga.</p>
            <p>An inspection of the section on which the derailment occurred disclosed 
              that the track was not so maintained as to provide the proper degree 
              of safety; at one place four consecutive ties were found to have 
              broken under the rail, and many spikes had been worked loose and 
              drawn by churning of the rails; indications of churning were most 
              common under the inside rail of curves at places where the ballast 
              consisted of cinders on top of stones and the cinders had worked 
              down between the stones and prevented proper drainage. On the curve 
              where train No. 95 was derailed, three low joints were found on 
              the inside rail; the depression at these joints was measured with 
              the wrecker standing on them. Two of these, which were the fifth 
              and third, respectively, north of the point of derailment, were 
              3/4 inch low; the other one, which was the first joint north of 
              where the train was derailed, was 7/8 inch low.</p>
            <p>It is obvious, however, that such tack conditions can not fail 
              to exist when the track repair gang for this section, which comprises 
              6 miles of main track and 2 miles of sidings, consists only of a 
              foreman and one man.</p>
            <p>While the cause of this accident was not definitely determined, 
              it is believed that when the locomotive of train No. 95 encountered 
              the low joints on the 5-degree 30-minute curve at a speed of 40 
              miles an hour a rocking motion was set up on the engine, and that 
              when it struck the third low joint it rocked sufficiently to raise 
              the left front wheel of the engine truck over the rail and allow 
              it to drop down on the outside of the curve.</p>
            <p>Section Foreman Bramlett had had seven years experience in track 
              repair work, and had been in charge of the section on which the 
              derailment occurred since March 14, 1918. Track Supervisor Riggs 
              had had more than 15 years of experience in track work, he having 
              been employed on other railroad before entering the service of the 
              Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway.</p>
