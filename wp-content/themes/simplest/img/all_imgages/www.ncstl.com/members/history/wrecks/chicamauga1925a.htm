            <p>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION</p>
              <p>REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION
                OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST.,
                LOUIS RAILWAY NEAR CHICKAMAUGA, TENN., ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1925.</p>
              <p>October 24, 1925.</p>
              <p>To the Commission:</p>
              <p>On September 21, 1925, there was a head-end collision between
                two passenger trains on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St.
                Louis Railway near Chickamauga, Tenn., which resulted in the
                death of 1 passenger, and the injury of 35 passengers 18 employees,
                and 3 Pullman porters.</p>
              <p><strong>Location and method of operation</strong></p>
              <p>This accident occurred on that part of the Atlanta Division
                extending between Junta, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance
                of 88.70 miles; in the vicinity of the point of accident this
                is a single-track line over which trains are operated by time-table
                and train orders, no block-signal system being in use. The accident
                occurred approximately 8,000 feet south of the south switch of
                the passing track at Chickamauga, on a fill about 25 feet in
                height approaching this point from the north there are 5,137
                feet of tangent, followed by a compound curve to the left 2,665
                feet in length. The accident occurred on this curve at a point
                1,199 feet from its northern end, where the curvature is slightly
                more than 20. Approaching from the south there are 443 feet of
                tangent, followed by the curve on which the accident occurred.
                The grade at the point of accident is 0.62 per cent ascending
                for southbound trains. Owing to the embankment of a cur on the
                east side of the track about 20 feet in height, just south of
                the fill on which the accident occurred, the view of the point
                of accident from the engineman's side of the cab of a northbound
                train is restricted to about 700 feet.</p>
              <p>The weather was clear at
                  the time of the accident. which occurred at about 3.21 p.m.</p>
              <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
              <p>Passenger train second No. 95, the Dixie Flyer southbound, consisted
                of one express car, one baggage car, two coaches, one dining
                car, and four Pullman sleeping cars, in the order named, hauled
                by engine 558, and was in charge of Conductor Davis and Engineman
                Green. The cars were of all-steel construction with the exception
                of the first and fifth cars, which had steel-underframes. Before
                departing from Chattanooga the, crew received, among others,
                a copy of train order No. 567, Form 31, reading in part as follows:</p>
              <p>&quot;C&amp;E *** 2nd *** No. 95.</p>
              <p>Third No. 94 Eng 562 will *** hold main track meet Second No.
                95 Eng. 568 at Chickamauga ***.&quot;</p>
              <p>Train second No. 95 departed from Chattanooga, 10.79 miles north
                of Chickamauga, at 2.57 p.m., 10 minutes late, passed Boyce,
                the last open office, 4.79 miles distant, at 3.11 p.m., 13 minutes
                late, and then passed Chickamauga, the meeting point. Shortly
                afterwards the conductor's attention was called to the fact that
                the meeting point had been passed, the air brakes were applied
                by the train porter by means of the conductor's emergency valve
                in the sixth car in the train, and the train was brought to a
                stop at a point approximately 8,000 feet south of the south switch
                of the passing track at Chickamauga; immediately after coming
                to a stop it was struck by train third No. 94.</p>
              <p>Passenger train third no. 94, the Dixie Flyer north-bound, consisted
                of one baggage car, three Pullman sleeping cars, one dining car,
                and four Pullman sleeping cars, in the order named, of all-steel
                construction, hauled by engine 562. and was in charge of Conductor
                Baldwin and Engineman Hamby. At Dalton, 26.93 miles south of
                Chickamauga. a copy of train order No. 567, Form 19, previously
                quoted, was received. The train departed from Dalton at 2.37
                p.m. left Graysville, 5.74 miles south of Chickamauga and the
                last open office, at 3.15 p.m., 3 hours late, and collided with
                train second No. 95 on reaching a point about 4 miles beyond
                Graysville while travelling at a speed estimated to have been
                about 35 miles an hour.</p>
              <p>Both engines, together with their tenders, and the first car
                in each train were entirely derailed; the forward truck of the
                second car in train second No. 95 was also derailed. None of
                the other equipment in either train was derailed or materially
                damaged. Engine 568, together with its tender and the baggage
                car, rolled down the embankment, on the outside of the curve
                and came to rest in an upright position parallel to, and 50 feet
                west of the track. Engine 562 also went down the embankment on
                the outside of the curve and came to rest bottom up, with its
                head end 25 feet and its rear end 10 feet west of the track;
                the tender was also bottom up, parallel to and just west of the
                engine. The first car in this train was on its left side, also
                down the embankment. Both engines were considerably damaged,
                while the forward end of the first car in train third No. 94
                was considerably crushed.</p>
              <p><strong>Summary of evidence</strong></p>
              <p>Conductor Davis, of train second No. 95, stated that at Chattanooga
                he received copy of train order No. 567, together with a clearance
                card, Form &quot;A&quot;, properly made out; the clearance can
                called for three train orders, which were received accordingly.
                The conductor said that when he was on his way to deliver a set
                of the orders to Engineman Green he informed Flagman Smith of
                the meet with train third No. 94 at Chickamauga, and that as
                he started away the flagman repeated &quot;Chickamauga?&quot;,
                and he replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Conductor Davis said that he
                also informed Train Porter Fielding of the meet order. On arriving
                at the engine he delivered the orders to Engineman Green and
                said they were to meet train third No. 94 at Chickamauga, and
                the engineman made some reply which the conductor did not understand;
                this was all the conversation he had with the engineman. While
                collecting tickets in the day coaches he had the train porter
                follow him and when he finished he placed the tickets in the
                porter's cap and had him take then forward and put them in the
                conductor's train box. telling him to stay there and head the
                train in at Chickamauga for train third No. 94. Conductor Davis
                then started toward the rear of the train, to be in a better
                position to see that the switches were handled properly at Chickamauga.
                On reaching the first Pullman car, this being the sixth car in
                the train, he met the Pullman conductor and engaged him in conversation
                relative to the number of passengers that had boarded the train
                at Chattanooga. One of the passengers in this car made a complaint
                about paying an extra fare, end he said that just before he had
                finished making explanations to this passenger he remembered
                about the meet at Chickamauga, and about this time the train
                porter entered the car and yelled &quot;Did you say meet third
                94 at Chickamauga?&quot; to which Conductor Davis replied &quot;Stop
                him!&quot; Train Porter Fielding, being near the conductor's
                emergency valve, opened it and brought the train to a stop, the
                collision occurring about five seconds afterwards. He further
                stated that he did not compare train orders with Engineman Green
                as he should have done; that he was trying to get away from Chattanooga
                on time and probably hurried away from the engineman too quickly,
                and that Flagman Smith did not personally read the orders but
                was informed of their contents, and he was positive that the
                flagman thoroughly understood them. Conductor Davis also stated
                that he did not bear the station whistle signal sounded for Chickamauga
                from his position in the train, being in the sixth car from the
                engine and that the time had elapsed so quickly that he did not
                realize the meeting point had been passed until the train was
                in the vicinity of Whorley's crossing, located 5,951 feet south
                of the south switch at Chickamauga.</p>
              <p>Engineman Green, of train second No. 95, stated that it was
                his custom to oil the engine at Chattanooga and that his hands
                get dirty and greasy, and almost invariably when Conductor Davis
                arrived with the orders he would ask the conductor to place them
                in a pocket of his overalls, which he said was the case in this
                instance. Conductor Davis then left without saying anything,
                after which Engineman Green set the oil can in the gangway, and
                read the clearance card and two of the orders - the running order
                and slow order -while standing beside the engine. About this
                time he received a proceed signal, put the orders in his pocket
                got up on his seat box and started; Travelling Engineer Austin,
                who was on the engine, and Fireman Brown were busy filling oil
                cane down on the deck of the engine at this time. Engineman Green
                said that just after starting he informed Fireman Brown of the
                running order and the slow order, saying they were all the orders
                he had, but did not show the orders to the fireman. He sounded
                the station whistle signal when approaching Chickamauga, and
                on reaching Whorley's crossing, about 1 mile south of Chickamauga,
                he heard one blast sounded on the communicating air whistle;
                this was a signal he and Conductor Davis had agreed should be
                used when the conductor wanted to transmit hand signals, and
                when he looked back and did not see any hand signals he did not
                pay any further attention to the matter. Shortly afterwards another
                blast was sounded and then the air brakes were applied from the
                rear of the train. After the train came to a stop those on the
                engine looked back in an endeavor to ascertain the trouble and
                while they were so engaged the collision occurred. Engineman
                Green said he might have had the meet order, but if he did have
                it he did not see it, and that he did not remove the orders from
                his pocket after boarding the engine at Chattanooga, being so
                engrossed in making a hurried departure behind the first section
                of the train that he forgot to show the orders to the fireman.
                He further stated that when he read the clearance card he did
                not have on his glasses, and while the operator's figure on the
                clearance card, showing the number of orders held for train second
                No. 95, was a plain 3, he said he must have read it for a 2,
                and he did not check the orders against the clearance card as
                the rules required It further appeared that Engineman Green had
                operated train second No. 94 in to Chattanooga, displaying signals
                for the following. section, train third No. 94, but when he departed
                from Chattanooga on train second No. 95, southbound, he did not
                know whether or not train third No. 94 had arrived as he had
                not checked the train register.</p>
              <p>Fireman Brown, of train second No. 95, stated that Engineman
                Green told him there were two train orders, a running order and
                a slow order, but the orders wore not shown to him nor did he
                ask to see them as he was busy at Chattanooga and forgot to ask
                for them after the train started. The station whistle signal
                was sounded approaching Chickamauga and at about Whorley's crossing
                one blast was received on the communicating air whistle signal,
                but the first he knew of anything wrong was when the air brakes
                were applied from the rear, the collision occurring just after
                the train came to a stop.</p>
              <p>Travelling Engineer Austin stated that he rode on the engine
                of train second No. 94 on the northbound trip, from Atlanta to
                Chattanooga, with Engineman Green; he also rode on the engine
                on the return trip on train second No. 95. He did not hear any
                conversation between Engineman Green and Fireman Brown as to
                what orders they held, nor did he see or inquire of the engineman
                as to the orders. He knew that train second No. 94 displayed
                signals for train third No. 94 on the northbound trip, but he
                did not know whether or not train third No. 94 had reached Chattanooga
                at the time train second No. 95 departed.</p>
              <p>Flagman Smith, of train second No. 95, stated that while he
                was assisting passengers on the train at Chattanooga, Conductor
                Davis came up behind him and said something but he did not know
                what it was; he maintained that he knew nothing whatever of the
                train orders received at Chattanooga, and that the first intimation
                he had of anything wrong was when the train came to a stop. He
                was aware the conductor received orders before leaving Chattanooga,
                and he said the rules require flagmen to read, understand, and
                assist in executing orders; however, he did not ask Conductor
                Davis to let him see the orders at Chattanooga as he was busy
                getting the passengers aboard and trying to get the train away
                on time, and after the train departed he did not see the conductor
                again prior to the time of the collision. Flagman Smith further
                stated that in view of recent instructions relative to the operation
                of trains Nos. 94 and 95 in sections, instructing flagmen to
                remain on the rear of these trains at all times except when it
                is necessary to leave the rear of the train for the purpose of
                protecting the same he was afraid to leave the rear of the train
                after departing from Chattanooga owing to the fact that there
                was a following section. Train Porter Fielding said that in conversation
                with Flagman Smith after the accident the flagman admitted he
                knew of the meet, having been told of it by the conductor before
                the train left Chattanooga. Conductor Davis also made a statement
                that he asked the flagman why he did not stop the train and that
                Flagman Smith said he did not know why he had not done so that
                he left the rear end and went forward through three cars in search
                of the conductor, and then returned to the rear end. Both of
                these conversations were denied by Flagman Smith.</p>
              <p>Baggagemaster Maddox, of train second No. 95, also stated that
                he knew nothing whatever about the train orders held leaving
                Chattanooga. At about the south switch at Chickamauga, Train
                Porter Fielding opened the baggage car door and inquired as to
                whether or not the conductor had informed the baggagemaster where
                they were supposed to meet train third No. 94, to which the baggagemaster
                replied in the negative, then the porter said &quot;Chickamauga&quot;.
                Baggagemaster Maddox said that he immediately started working
                his way through the baggage, the car being heavily loaded with
                it, in an endeavor to reach the conductor's emergency valve,
                which he said was located in the center of this car, with a cord
                leading from it toward each end of the car; on looking up he
                did not at first see the cord but shortly afterwards he saw that
                it was tied to a bracket near the rear door, but the air brakes
                were applied before he had reached it. He did not recall having
                heard the meeting-point whistle signal sounded when approaching
                Chickamauga. The Commission's inspectors were afterwards informed
                by the superintendent's office that when further questioned the
                baggagemaster admitted that he became confused when he realized
                that a collision was imminent and made no attempt to stop the
                train.</p>
              <p>Train Porter Fielding, of train second No. 95, stated that ordinarily
                Conductor Davis gave him the train orders to read but on this
                occasion he only told him of the meet at Chickamauga with train
                third No. 94. When the train did not slow down approaching the
                north switch he hesitated about taking immediate steps toward
                bringing it to a stop as Engineman Green had always been very
                particular in regard to complying with orders; furthermore, he
                was not positive as to the meet at Chickamauga, and did not want
                to cause any unnecessary delay by opening the conductor's emergency
                valve, or subject himself to a reprimand for bringing the train
                to a stop in the event there was no meet arranged for at this
                point. Therefore, he said he sounded two blasts on the communicating
                whistle, just after the train passed over the north switch, at
                which time he was riding in the third Car, to call the engineman's
                attention to the meet, then went to the baggage car and inquired
                of Baggagemaster Maddox as to the meet at Chickamauga, but the
                baggagemaster knew nothing about what orders had been received.
                Porter Fielding then ran through the cars toward the rear of
                the train and on locating Conductor Davis in the sixth car asked
                about the meet at Chickamauga, and the conductor shouted &quot;Stop
                him!&quot; Train porter Fielding immediately opened the conductor's
                emergency valve, the collision occurring just after the train
                came to a stop. He also said the station whistle signal was sounded
                approaching Chickamauga but the meeting-point signal was not
                sounded.</p>
              <p>Passenger Our inspector Long stored that after testing the air
                brakes on train second to. 95 at Chattanooga he reported to Engineman
                Green that they were in proper working order; at the time this
                report was made the engineman was along the left side of the
                engine holding three orders and a clearance card in his hand,
                two Form 31 orders and one Form 19 order.</p>
              <p>Engineman Hamby, of train third No. 94, stated that he was unaware
                of anything wrong until after passing through the cut while rounding
                the curve at a speed of about 40 or 45 miles an hour, and on
                seeing train second No. 95 a short distance away he immediately
                applied the air brakes in emergency, shouted to the fireman,
                closed the throttle, and reversed the engine. The statements
                of Fireman Cooper practically corroborated those of Engineman
                Hamby. None of the other members of the crew was aware of anything
                wrong until the air brakes were applied in emergency just prior
                to the accident; Conductor Baldwin estimated the speed to have
                been about 38 or 40 miles an hour at the time of the accident.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
              <p>This accident was caused by the failure of train second No.
                95 to comply with the requirements of a train order and meet
                train third No. 94 at Chickamauga, for which Engineman Green
                and Conductor Davis are primarily responsible.</p>
              <p>Rules 83 and 211a, respectively, of the Rules Governing the
                Operating Department read in part as follows:</p>
              <p>83 - &quot;A train must not lease its initial station on any
                division *** until it has been ascertained whether all trains
                due *** of the same class have arrived or left.</p>
              <p>&quot;Conductors and enginemen must consult train registers.&quot;</p>
              <p>211A - &quot; *** On passenger trains, conductors must show
                all train orders to flagmen, and enginemen must show to firemen.
                ***&quot;.</p>
              <p>In addition there are printed instructions at the bottom of
                the clearance card requiring conductors and enginemen to see
                that the total number of orders received corresponds with the
                number inserted on the clearance card.</p>
              <p>Engineman Green admitted that he did not check the train register
                before departing from Chattanooga, leaving without knowing whether
                or not train third No. 94 had arrived, although on the northbound
                trip he operated the second section of train No. 94 into Chattanooga
                and at that time signals were displayed for the third section
                of that train, this being the train with which train second No.
                95 collided. Furthermore, he admitted that he did not show the
                orders to the fireman; also that the figure on the clearance
                card, showing the number of orders, was a plain 3, and that had
                he checked the orders against the clearance card the meet order
                would not have been overlooked.</p>
              <p>Conductor Davis admitted that he did not properly compare the
                train orders with the engineman, as he was engrossed in making
                a hurried departure from Chattanooga, not did he show the orders
                to the Flagman, as required by the rules. Had either of these
                employees paid proper attention to the handling of the orders
                received this accident would have been averted.</p>
              <p>The rules also require firemen and flagmen to read train orders,
                yet neither of these employees made any effort to ascertain the
                contents of the train orders received at Chattanooga. Had they
                made themselves familiar with the orders as required by the rules
                this accident might have been prevented. There was a dispute
                as to whether or not Flagman Smith knew of the meet with train
                third No. 94; if he had this information, he is equally at fault
                with the conductor and engineman for the occurrence of this accident.</p>
              <p>An automatic block-signal system is now being installed on this
                division. Had this system been in operation this accident probably
                would not have occurred; an adequate automatic train stop or
                train control device would have prevented it.</p>
              <p>All of the employees involved were experienced men; at the time
                of the accident none of them had been on duty in violation of
                any of the provisions of the hours of service law.</p>
              <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
              <p>W. P. BORLAND,</p>
              <p>Director.</p>
