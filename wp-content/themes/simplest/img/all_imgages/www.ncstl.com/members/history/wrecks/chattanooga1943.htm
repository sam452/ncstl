            <p><strong>Diagram </strong></p>
            <p>Inv-2744 Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway Chattanooga,
              Tenn. November 22, 1943</p>
            <p><strong>Location of Accident and Method of Operation</strong></p>
            <p>This accident occurred on that part of the Chattanooga Division
              extending between Nashville and Chattanooga, Tenn., 151.71 miles.
              In the vicinity of the point of accident this a double-track line,
              within yard limits, over which trains were operated by timetable
              and-train orders. There was no block system in use. Between N.
              Y. Tower, and East End Avenue, respectively, 2.6 miles north and
              1.14 miles south of Chattanooga, trains and yard engines of the
              Southern Railway, hereinafter referred to as the Southern, were
              operated over the tracks of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St.
              Louis Railway, hereinafter referred to as-the N. C. &amp; St. L.
              In the vicinity of the point of accident-three crossovers connected
              the north ward and the southward main tracks. The most- northerly
              cross over, 175 feet in length, was facing-point for movements
              with the current of traffic, and its south switch was 2,159 feet
              north of the station. The accident occurred on the southward main
              track at the fouling point of crossover No. 1, 67 feet north of
              the south switch. From the north there was a tangent 2,813 feet
              to the point of accident. From the south there were, in succession,
              a tangent 3,370 feet in length, a 13 degrees 36 curve to the left
              1,110 feet, a tangent 683 feet and a turnout to the left 67 feet
              to the point of accident. The grade was practically level.</p>
            <p>The switch-stand for the south-switch of crossover No. 1 was of
              the hand-throw low-stand type. The switch lamp was electrically
              lighted, and the center of each lens Was 12-3/8 inches above the
              level of the top of the rail and 6 feet 4-3/4 inches west of the
              center-line of the track. The lenses were 4-1/4 inches in diameter
              and-were provided with 9-inch flared-disc reflectors. When the
              switch was lined for entry to the crossover a red aspect and a
              red disc were displayed.</p>
            <p><strong>Operating rules read in part as follows:</strong></p>

            <p>Description of Accident</p>
            <p>No. 3, a south-bound first-class N. C. &amp; St. L. passenger
              train, consisted of engine 580, express cars, two mail cars, two
              express-mail cars, one passenger-baggage car three coaches, one
              dining car and two Pullman sleeping cars, in the order named. The
              first, two cars were of steel-underframe construction, and the
              remainder were of Steel construction. This train passed N. Y. Tower,
              2.6 miles north of Chattanooga and the last open office, at 2:15
              a.m., 10 minutes late, and stopped on the southward main track
              with the engine standing 180 feet south of the south switch of
              crossover No. 1 at 2:20 a.m. About 2 minutes later the second and
              third cars were struck by yard engine 1672.</p>
            <p>Southern yard engine 1672, headed south, was coupled to the north
              end of a cut of 20 passenger-equipment cars, which consisted of
              9 Pullman sleeping cars and 11 tourist-sleeping cars. After a terminal
              air-brake test was made at Citico Yard, about 2.5 miles south of
              the point of accident, this cut of cars departed northward about
              1:55 a.m., entered the N. C. &amp; St., L. northward main track
              at East End Avenue, and while moving at an estimated speed of 8
              to 15 miles per hour it entered crossover No. 1 and collided with
              the second and third cars of No. 3.</p>
            <p>The east side of the second car of No. 3 was slightly damaged
              and the rear truck was derailed. The front truck of the third car
              was derailed and the front end was crushed. The tender of engine
              1672 stopped on its left side, across the northward main track
              and at right angles to it. Both trucks were detached. Engine 1672
              was derailed, and stopped upright about 20 feet south of the tender
              and parallel to it. The cab was damaged. The firs car in the yard
              cut was derailed and the front end was damaged.</p>
            <p>It was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred about
              2:22 a.m.</p>
            <p>The fireman of the yard engine was killed, and the engineer of
              the yard engine was injured.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>The rules of this carrier governing operation within that part
              of the yard limits at Chattanooga where the accident occurred provide
              that all trains and engines may use the main track hut must be
              operated prepared to stop within the range of vision. In addition,
              enginemen must know that switches are lined properly for the movement
              of their train.</p>
            <p>About 2:20 a.m., No. 5, a south-bound passenger train, stopped
              on the southward main track with the engine standing 180 feet south
              of the south switch of a facing-point crossover. About 2 minutes
              later the second and third cars of this train were struck by yard
              engine 1672. This engine, in backward motion and moving northward
              on the northward main track, was pulling a cut o passenger-equipment
              cars. As it was approaching crossover No. 1, the headlight on the
              tender was lighted, the speed was from 8 to 15 miles per hour,
              and the engineer was maintaining a lookout ahead. From the engineers
              location in the cab a clear view could be had of crossover switch-lamps
              between the main tracks at points 259 feet, 250 feet, 74 feet and
              67 feet south of the point of accident, The switch-stand involved
              was 7 feet north of another crossover switch-stand and in line
              with it. About the time that engine 1672 arrived at the south switch
              of crossover No. 1, the engineer looked toward the rear of the
              cut of cars for lantern signals. The engine entered the crossover
              and the collision occurred immediately afterward. After the accident,
              the south switch was found lined for movement through the crossover,
              and the switch lock was lying on a tie near the latch. The switch
              lamp was 5 feet west of the southward main track and about 25 feet
              north of the switch.</p>
            <p>Yard engine 1672 was required to be operated so that it could
              be stopped short of any switch not properly lined. The engineer
              said that he had not been examined on the operating rules of the
              N. C. &amp; St. L., but was familiar with the physical characteristics
              and the track arrangement in the territory involved. Bulletins
              of the N C. &amp; St. L. were posted on Southern bulletin boards.
              Two switch-lamp aspects should have been displayed in the vicinity
              of the south switch, but the engineer said that he saw only one
              aspect, which was green. He attached no particular significance
              to this as he thought that the N. C. &amp; St. L. might have made
              some change recently in the track arrangement; however, he had
              not observed any N. C. &amp; St. L. bulletin concerning any change.
              It is not known if the fireman observed any abnormal condition,
              as he was killed in the accident. No other member of the crew observed
              anything wrong in the vicinity of the switch. A yard engine of
              the N. C. &amp; St. L. last used this crossover about 2:15 a.m.
              A member of this crew said that he lined the switch for movement
              on the northward main track and locked it, but at that time there
              was no lamp attached to the switch-stand. Another member of this
              crew said that the light was not burning, but he did not observe
              if the lamp was attached to the switch-stand. If the switch-lamp
              had been in proper position and lighted, a red aspect would have
              been displayed when the switch was open. This aspect would have
              been plainly visible to the crew of the Southern yard engine, and
              the accident would no doubt have been prevented.</p>
            <p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
            <p>It is found that this accident was caused by the absence of a
              light with which the switch was normally equipped, and by failure
              properly to control the speed of a yard engine moving within yard
              limits.</p>
