            <p>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION.</p>
            <p>REPORT OF THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF SAFETY COVERING THE INVESTIGATION 
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; 
              ST. LOUIS RAILWAY NEAR ROCKLEDGE, TENN., ON DECEMBER 23, 1915.</p>
            <p>JANUARY 17,1916.</p>
            <p>To the commission:</p>
            <p>On December 23, 1915, there was a head end collision between northbound 
              passenger train first No. 2 and southbound freight train No. 55 
              on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway near Rockledge 
              block station, between Cowan and Sherwood, Tenn., resulting in the 
              death of 2 employees on duty and 10 employees not on duty, and the 
              injury of 3 passengers, 4 employees on duty, and 37 employees not 
              on duty. After investigation as to the nature and cause of this 
              accident, I beg to submit the following report:</p>
            <p>On the date of the accident, regular passenger train No. 2, running 
              from Atlanta, Ga., to Nashville, Tenn., was late. The passenger 
              train which was involved in this accident was made up at Chattanooga. 
              It left Chattanooga at 1.35 p.m., on the time of train No. 2, and 
              was run as the first section of that train. It consisted of locomotive 
              419 and 4 coaches, and was in charge of Conductor Hancock and Engineman 
              Reed. Train first No. 2 arrived at Sherwood at 3.36 p.m., four minutes 
              late, met train No. 95, and departed at 3.47 p.m., having received 
              a clear block signal indication at that point. This train had proceeded 
              to a point approximately 4 miles north of Sherwood when, at about 
              3.55 p.m., it collided with train No. 55.</p>
            <p>Southbound train No. 55, consisting of locomotive 610, 45 cars 
              and a caboose, with Conductor Wiggs and Engineman Gribble in charge, 
              left Nashville at 11.10 a.m., 2 hours and 30 minutes late. At Cowan, 
              a station 3 miles north of Rockledge two additional locomotives 
              were attached to train No. 55 to assist it over a grade between 
              Cowan and Rockledge. Upon its arrival at Rockledge, at about 3.45 
              p.m., the block operator at that point headed train No. 55 into 
              the siding as is customary, so as to permit the helping locomotive 
              on the head end to cut off and get into clear on a &quot;runaway&quot; 
              track at the south</p>
            <p>Thirty three foot, 90-pound rails are used in this portion of the 
              track with from 19 to 21 oak ties to the rail length; rock ballast 
              is used, and the track is maintained in good condition.</p>
            <p>Between Cowan and Sherwood, a distance of 9 miles, trains are operated 
              under a form of the controlled manual block system, with continuous 
              track circuits, no train orders being used. There are two block 
              sections, one extending from Cowan to Rockledge, and the other from 
              Rockledge to Sherwood. At Rockledge there is a passing siding having 
              a capacity of 49 cars. This siding extends north of Rockledge tower 
              nearly to the portal of a tunnel at the summit of the grade, and 
              the southern end is around a curve and out of sight from the tower. 
              The north end of the passing track is interlocked in the usual manner, 
              the southbound signal at that point having two arms, one governing 
              movements on the main line and the other governing movements into 
              the siding. At the south end of the siding an extension is provided, 
              running up the side of the mountain and serving as a runaway track. 
              The switches between siding and runaway track, and siding and main 
              line, are not controlled from the tower, but are bolt locked, so 
              that the main track switch has to be opened first, and they must 
              be closed in reverse order. A high semaphore signal, located to 
              the right of the main line opposite the fouling point, serves as 
              a block signal and is semiautomatic. It is also controlled by a 
              switch box, so that it will not clear if the main track switch is 
              set for the siding. A dwarf signal similarly operated governs movements 
              from the siding to the main line and into the block. The control 
              circuits for this signal are not cut through the switch box so that 
              it may be cleared irrespective of the position of the switches. 
              There is no repeater in the tower to give the operator positive 
              information regarding the position of signals at that point. All 
              signals used are electrically operated, of the three position type, 
              and giving indications in the lower right hand quadrant. Between 
              Rockledge and Sherwood there are one southbound and three northbound 
              automatic spacing signals, operating in two positions only, caution 
              and clear.</p>

            <p>No. 1--View of scene of accident, looking north, showing bent rail 
              opposite point of collision.</p>
            <p>At both ends of each block special block instruments are provided 
              which require the cooperation of signalmen at both ends of the block 
              in order to give a train a signal permitting it to enter the block. 
              Telephones are provided as a means of communication between block 
              offices, and train movements are governed entirely by signal indications. 
              At the time this accident occurred the signal maintainer for this 
              section, a telephone lineman, in the employ of the railway company, 
              and a gang of Western Union linemen were at work a short distance 
              south of Rockledge transferring the pole line carrying both signal 
              and telegraph wires to a new location farther away from the railroad 
              track.</p>
            <p>When train No. 55 entered the siding at Rockledge and stopped to 
              permit the helper locomotive to out off and go up into the &quot;runaway&quot; 
              track, the rear end of the train projected out on to the main track. 
              After the helper locomotive had pulled up into the &quot;runaway&quot; 
              track the crew, observing that the dwarf signal was in the clear 
              position, and following the customary practice, throw the switches 
              and signaled the freight train ahead. It started out on to the main 
              line and proceeded toward Sherwood. Previous to this time train 
              first No. 2 had entered the block at Sherwood under a clear signal, 
              and when train No. 55 pulled ahead the operator at Rockledge, knowing 
              that the block was already occupied by train No. 2 and that he had 
              not cleared the dwarf signal at the south end of the siding, supposed 
              at first that train No. 55 was merely pulling ahead to clear the 
              main line; but when it did not stop he realized that it was going 
              out on the main line, and he endeavored to attract the attention 
              of the train crew for the purpose of stopping the train. Failing 
              in that, he telephoned Sherwood, but train first No. 2 had already 
              left that point. He then telephoned a section foremans house between 
              Sherwood and Rockledge, but train No. 2 had passed, and it was too 
              late to avert the collision.</p>

              He stated that his train received a clear signal at Sherwood. The

            <p>Conductor Wiggs, of train No. 55, stated that upon his arrival 
              at Rockledge he started to go to the tower, but shortly after his 
              train had stopped on the siding it started ahead and continued out 
              on the main line. Soon after passing the tower he started forward 
              over the train to confer with the engineman regarding work at Sherwood 
              and had reached a point 12 or 15 cars from the engine when the collision 
              occurred. He stated that he saw the operator in the tower as his 
              train passed, but at that time there was nothing to indicate that 
              anything was wrong.</p>
            <p>Rear Brakeman Hamrick, of train No. 55, stated that as the train 
              was pulling out of the siding he noticed a car jumping, and went 
              forward to find out whether there was anything wrong with it. He 
              stated that he found nothing out of order and went back to the rear 
              end about the time the caboose passed the switches at the south 
              end of Rockledge siding. He did not notice the position of the signal 
              at that time. He stated that he rode on top of the train down to 
              the point where it stopped at the time of the collision, then went 
              back to flag. He did not know that a collision had occurred until 
              a relief train came out.</p>

            <p>Engineman Gribble, of train No. 55, stated that when his train 
              came to a stop on the siding at Rockledge and the helper locomotive 
              had gone into clear, he heard the helper sound the whistle signal 
              for him to proceed. He asked the fireman the condition of the signal 
              and switches, and upon being informed that the signal was clear 
              and the switches were lined up to permit him to go out on the main 
              track, he released the brakes and started out of the siding. He 
              stated that the dwarf signal governing movements out on to the main 
              line was in the clear position when he passed it, and as this signal 
              indication gave him the absolute right to the block and there was 
              nothing out of the ordinary in this movement he had no thought of 
              impending danger. He did not see train first No. 2 before the collision 
              occurred and did not remember anything that occurred after entering 
              Hominy Hill cut until after the collision, when the fireman came 
              to assist him out of the cab.</p>
            <p>Fireman Gilmore, of train No. 55, stated that after the helper 
              locomotive signaled his train to come ahead the engineman asked 
              him the condition of the signal and switches, and as soon as they 
              came into view he saw that the signal was clear, the switches were 
              lined up for a movement to the main track and a man from the pusher 
              locomotive was signaling them to come ahead. He stated that he saw 
              the locomotive of train first No. 2 just before the collision, but 
              he did not have time even to warn the engineman.</p>
            <p>Head Brakeman Marshall, of train No. 55, stated that while the 
              train was standing on the siding he got on the head car for the 
              purpose of turning up retainers when the train started down the 
              mountain. He saw the signal in the clear position before the train 
              started out of the siding. He was back about eight car lengths from 
              the locomotive when the collision occurred. He stated that he had 
              been looking ahead, but did not see any smoke and had no intimation 
              that train first No. 2 was approaching.</p>
            <p>Operator Johns, at Sherwood, and Operator Christian, at Rockledge, 
              stated that a clear signal was given to train first No. 2 in the 
              usual manner, and the block records show that train first No. 2 
              entered the block at Sherwood at 3.47 p.m. Operator Johns stated 
              that he saw the train pass the northbound signal at Sherwood and 
              saw that signal go to danger properly after the train passed. Operator 
              Christian stated that as train No. 55 was approaching Rockledge 
              he learned from the dispatcher that train No. 55 should wait there 
              for train first No. 2, and he therefore turned train No. 55 into 
              the passing track. When the train stopped, the rear end did not 
              clear the main line, and when the train started up soon afterwards 
              he supposed it was pulling into clear. He started to enter the time 
              of arrival in his block sheet, and looked at the clock, and then 
              noting that the train was still moving he thought it was going too 
              far. At about that time he heard a single stroke bell ring, which 
              indicated that the head end of the train had passed out of the siding 
              and on to the main-line. He stated that he had not cleared the signal 
              for this train, and that from the position of the levers and instruments 
              in the tower the signals at the south end of the passing track should 
              have been in stop position. As soon as he realized that train No. 
              55 was out on the main line he endeavored to attract the attention 
              of the train crew, and then tried to stop train first No. 2 at Sherwood, 
              and at the section house, but was unable to do so.</p>
            <p>Engineman Kinningham, of helper locomotive 451, stated that as 
              his locomotive passed the dwarf signal at the south end of Rockledge 
              passing track, after cutting off from the head end of train No. 
              55, that signal was not entirely down to clear position and he made 
              some remark about it to the signal maintainer who was standing near 
              by. The signal maintainer replied that the signal was clear then 
              and Engineman Kinningham, looking back, saw that it was clear. He 
              stated that the fireman and the helper threw the switches and he 
              then signaled train No. 55 to proceed. He stated that the first 
              intimation he had that anything was wrong was when the fireman soon 
              afterwards went to a telephone for the purpose of obtaining instructions 
              from the operator regarding the movement of his locomotive, and 
              learned from the operator that he had not cleared the signal and 
              that train first No. 2 had left Sherwood.</p>
            <p>Fireman Miller and Helper Sargent, of locomotive 451, stated that 
              when the helper locomotive had pulled into clear on the &quot;runaway&quot; 
              track they saw that the dwarf signal was clear, and threw the switches 
              to permit train No. 55 to proceed. They stated that ordinarily this 
              signal returned to the stop position as soon as a train passed out 
              of the siding onto the main line, but in this case it did not return 
              to stop position. Fireman Miller stated that he called the attention 
              of Maintainer Hixon to the signal standing clear after the train 
              had gone out onto the main line.</p>
            <p>Maintainer Hixon stated that when the helper locomotive pulled 
              into clear on the &quot;runaway&quot; track he went over there to 
              get a drink of water and the engineman told him that the signal 
              was at caution. He stated he looked back and saw the signal was 
              in the clear position and told the engineman that it was clear. 
              After train No. 55 had pulled out on the main line either the fireman 
              or the helper called to him that the signal was still clear. He 
              stated that he ran up there, opened the high signal case, and saw 
              that the relay in that case, controlling the dwarf signal, was energized. 
              He shunted the coils of this relay, and its armature dropped, the 
              signal going to danger position; he removed the shunt and the signal 
              cleared up about halfway and then went back to danger. At about 
              this time he learned from the fireman of the helper locomotive that 
              the operator had not cleared the dwarf signal for train No. 55 and 
              that train first No. 2 had left Sherwood, and he then realized that 
              this signal had given a false clear indication to train No. 55. 
              As that train had gone, and he could do nothing to stop it, he immediately 
              started to make an examination of the signal and telegraph wires, 
              for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of the false clear signal 
              indication. Western Union linemen were at work at this point transferring 
              wires and pole line to a new location farther away from the track, 
              and the signal maintainer, assisted by a lineman, was transferring 
              the signal wires to the new pole line. As this pole line is located 
              on the outside of a curve at this point it was necessary to lengthen 
              the wires by &quot;cutting in slack,&quot; and at the time this 
              false clear signal occurred there were some bare joints in the signal 
              wires. Near this location, also, a pile of old ties had some time 
              before been burned under the wires, charring the insulation on the 
              signal wires. Maintainer Hixon stated that he did not find any cross 
              between the signal wires which might have caused this signal to 
              indicate clear improperly, and while he did not see any of the Western 
              Union telegraph wires in contact with the railway companys signal 
              wires at that time, it was his opinion that the relay controlling 
              the dwarf signal must have been energized by foreign current, and 
              he thought this foreign current must have come from a cross with 
              one of the Western Union telegraph wires at the place where the 
              signal-wire insulation had been damaged by fire. He stated that 
              a day or two after the accident occurred he found two places where 
              guy wires were touching the railroad companys common wire extending 
              from Sherwood to Rockledge. This caused a heavy ground, and he stated 
              that with this condition, if a cross occurred between a Western 
              Union telegraph wire and the control wire for the dwarf signal at 
              the south end of Rockledge passing track, the signal would clear 
              up.</p>
            <p>Maintainer Hixon and Signal Engineer Plasterer stated that on the 
              day following the accident tests were made by crossing the dwarf 
              signal control wire with other signal wires, and with the Western 
              Union telegraph wires. They stated the cross with the other signal 
              wires had no effect on the signal, but that the signal cleared twice 
              when crosses were established between this control wire and one 
              of the Western Union telegraph wires. They also stated that shortly 
              after the accident occurred they made an examination of an interlocking 
              relay located about halfway between Rockledge and Sherwood; the 
              position of the armatures of this relay demonstrated beyond question 
              that train first No. 2 entered the block at Sherwood before train 
              No. 55 entered the block at Rockledge.</p>
            <p>In statements of the :Western Union linemen who wore at Rockledge 
              at the time of the accident it was brought out that, at the point 
              north of Sherwood where the ground on the signal common wire was 
              found after the accident had occurred, some of the guy anchors had 
              not been moved when the poles were moved back, but the guy wires 
              had simply been lengthened out and attached to the same anchors 
              at their original locations. At the time this work was completed 
              none of the guy wires was in contact with any of the railroad signal 
              wires, but afterwards rocks dumped by a railroad construction gang 
              had fallen upon two of these gay wires, forcing them down and into 
              contact with one of the signal wires. It was also stated that particular 
              care was exercised in transferring the pole line and wires to the 
              new location to prevent any contact or cross between telegraph and 
              railroad signal wires, positive statements being made that no such 
              cross occurred.</p>
            <p>This accident was caused by a false clear indication of the dwarf 
              signal at the south end of the passing track at Rockledge, due to 
              foreign current.</p>
            <p>The investigation of this accident establishes the fact that the 
              relay controlling this dwarf signal was energized by current which 
              came from some source external to the normal control circuit. But 
              at the time this false clear signal occurred it was not determined 
              where this current did come from, and as it is now impossible to 
              duplicate exactly the conditions then existing, it is impossible 
              to determine positively the source of this current. The fact is 
              established that the signal common wire between Rockledge and Sherwood 
              was grounded. This condition was not discovered until after the 
              accident occurred, but the records of work disclose that it must 
              have existed at the time of the accident. When the signal maintainer 
              discovered these grounds on the common wire he unfastened this wire 
              from the insulators and moved it back on the cross arms to a position 
              out of contact with the guy wires. During investigation of this 
              accident tests wore made on December 28 to demonstrate whether or 
              not the dwarf signal could be cleared by crossing the control wire 
              for the dwarf signal with Western Union telegraph wires and also 
              with other signal wires. The ground connection to the common wire 
              was restored. The crosses established between the control wire and 
              other signal wires had no effect on the signals, but the dwarf signal 
              was cleared when crosses were made between its control wire and 
              each of 12 of the Western Union telegraph wires.</p>
            <p>Tests were made to ascertain whether or not the track rails carried 
              any foreign current; these tests failed to disclose the presence 
              of any foreign current in the rails. It is apparent from an examination 
              of the signal wiring diagram that by introducing certain combinations 
              of crosses and grounds it would be possible to obtain sufficient 
              power from one or more of the railroad companys other signal batteries 
              to clear the dwarf signal, but no tests were made to demonstrate 
              this, as there was no evidence to show that such crosses or grounds 
              did exist at the time of the accident.</p>
            <p>At the time of this false clear signal indication there was considerable 
              disarrangement of both signal wires and telegraph wires. Several 
              of the signal wires had been removed from the poles, the insulation 
              had been taken off at certain points, and slack had been cut in 
              preparatory to transferring them to the new location. The joints 
              in these wires had not yet been taped up and the wires were sagging 
              down from the poles which had not yet been moved; some of them were 
              either lying on the ground or hanging a short distance above the 
              ground. The signal wires leading from the pole line to the signals 
              had also been lengthened and these wires were lying on the ground 
              near the base of the pole opposite the signal location, which pole 
              had not been moved; the joints in these wires had not yet been taped. 
              The signal maintainer stated that when he examined the signal wires 
              after the false clear signal was discovered he failed to find any 
              cross between them, or any bare joints touching. Western Union telegraph 
              linemen stated, however, that the signal wires were lying on the 
              ground badly tangled up, and that later when the wires were put 
              up on the pole line it required some little time to get them straightened 
              out and arranged in their proper places.</p>
            <p>In moving the pole line the Western Union wires were detached from 
              alternate poles; these poles were then taken down and set in their 
              new locations. The wires were then transferred from the poles in 
              the former line to the poles which had been set in the new line. 
              The telegraph wires were no doubt sagging down somewhat for two 
              pole lengths in the old line, but the evidence is that only one 
              telegraph wire was transferred at a time and the necessary slack 
              was cut in at the time this wire was moved over to the new pole 
              line, the acting foreman himself letting off the wire gradually 
              as it was moved over, and making the joint before removing the blocks. 
              He stated that in view of the conditions existing at the time, it 
              was impossible for the telegraph wires to get into contact with 
              the signal wires, for the reason that slack had been cut in the 
              signal wires, and except where they rested on the crossarms they 
              sagged down a distance of 14 or 15 feet below the telegraph wires. 
              However, the signal maintainer stated that in the evening following 
              the accident, after the Western Union men had left their work for 
              the night, he found three or four of the Western Union wires in 
              contact with the railroad companys signal wires near a junction 
              pole where the signal wires did not sag down very far, and it was 
              near this point that the insulation on the signal wires had been 
              damaged by fire.</p>
            <p>On the night of December 28 the same dwarf signal which gave the 
              false clear indication leading to this accident remained in the 
              clear position after a southbound train left the siding. The cause 
              was later discovered to be a cross of wires in a temporary lead 
              encased cable leading to the northbound spacing signal, a short 
              distance south of the interlocking relay; this probably caused the 
              signal battery to be crossed with a wire leading to the interlocking 
              relay, holding that relay energized when it should have been deenergized 
              owing to the position of the southbound train. A careful investigation, 
              both of the plans and on the ground, leads to the conclusion that 
              this cross could have had no bearing on the accident on the 23d, 
              for the reason that the track conditions and the conditions of signal 
              apparatus in the block towers were quite different at the time of 
              the accident from those that existed at the time of the signal failure 
              on the 28th.</p>
            <p>In this connection it is noted that men wore working on the Western 
              Union wires at the time of the occurrence of the false clear signal 
              which caused the accident; the lineman in the employ of the railroad 
              company, who had been assigned to assist Maintainer Hixon was at 
              that time also working on Western Union wires. The conditions which 
              caused the signal to clear up soon disappeared, and in the meantime 
              the signal wires evidently were not touched or disturbed. It does 
              not appear that in this case the signal wires were handled any differently 
              than is frequently done in work of this character, although probably 
              no great care was taken to prevent crosses or grounds in the signal 
              wires when they were being transferred to the new pole line. On 
              account of the nature of signal circuits, however, it is not necessary 
              to exercise as great care in handling wires of this kind as with 
              telegraph or telephone wires.</p>
            <p>This is the first accident that has been investigated and, in fact, 
              the only one reported since the commissions accident investigation 
              work was begun which is positively known to have been caused by 
              a false clear block signal indication. It is known that signals 
              do sometimes give clear indications improperly, but there are very 
              few occurrences of this kind -- only a very small fraction of 1 
              per cent of the total number of signal operations -- and accidents 
              caused by such false clear signal indications are exceedingly rare 
              and infrequent. In general, signal circuits are so designed that 
              a single cross, ground, or other abnormal condition among the signal 
              wires themselves will not cause signals to clear up or remain clear 
              improperly. The dangers from foreign current, however, are well 
              recognized. Stray ground currents may follow the rails of railroad 
              tracks for considerable distances and hold track relays energized 
              improperly. In localities where trouble from this cause is particularly 
              likely to occur, as for example where there are many electric railway 
              lines, many railroad companies have installed alternating current 
              signal apparatus, which is less likely to be affected by foreign 
              current. The danger of a cross between signal-line wires and other 
              wires used for the transmission of power or for telegraphy, or wires 
              carrying current for electric lighting, is always present, and as 
              much of the railroad signal apparatus in common use is normally 
              operated by comparatively low voltages, sufficient current would 
              be supplied by a cross with any of these wires to operate signals. 
              Insulated wires are ordinarily used for signal circuits, and on 
              some railroads signal wires are run on separate pole lines to reduce 
              the liability of crosses with other wires. But even these precautions 
              do not remove all danger of crosses, as they may occur at pole line 
              crossings; the insulation, is not intended for high voltages and 
              it may become worn or stripped off, leaving line wires exposed, 
              without interfering with the normal operation of the system.</p>
            <p>The installation of signal apparatus and circuits on this line 
              between Cowan and Sherwood appears complicated, but while it includes 
              some special features not ordinarily found in installations of the 
              controlled manual block system, the circuits appear in general to 
              be well designed and to provide for most contingencies of operation. 
              This signal installation is more or less isolated. In view of its 
              location, even the best modern signal engineering practice would 
              not call for the use of alternating current apparatus or any other 
              special precautions against foreign current. More complete protection 
              would have been provided in this particular situation if the main 
              track switch at the south end of Rockledge passing track was controlled 
              from the tower, and in that event this accident would probably have 
              been averted.</p>
