              <br>
              REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA AND
              ST LOUIS RAILWAY AT KENNESAW, GA, ON DECEMBER 22, 1923<br>
              <br>
              February 27, 1924<br>
              <br>
              TO THE COMMISSION<br>
              <br>
              On December 22, 1923, there was a derailment of a passenger train
              on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway at Kennesaw,
              Ga, resulting in the death of one employee, and the injury of one
              passenger and two employees.<br>
              <br>
              LOCATION AND METHOD OF OPERATION<br>
              <br>
              This accident occurred on that part of the Atlanta Division extending
              between Junta and Atlanta, Ga , a distance of 47 66 miles, trains
              of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad also use this portion
              of the track In the vicinity of the point of accident this is a
              single-track line over which trains are operated by time-table,
              train orders, and a manual block-signal system The accident occurred
              just south of the station at Kennesaw Approaching this point from
              the north there is a short tangent, followed by a compound curve
              to the left 1,578 feet in length, with a curvature varying from
              4 degrees 09&#8217; to 5 degrees 08&#8217;, the accident occurring
              on this curve at a point 1,190 feet horn its northern end, where
              the curvature is at its maximum The grade for southbound trains
              is ascending for about 6 miles, being 0 9 percent at its maximum,
              to within 340 feet of the point of accident, from which pint it
              is 0.28 per cent descending for a considerable distance beyond
              the point of accident. The track in this vicinity is laid with
              91-pound rails, 33 feet in length, with an average of 18 oak ties
              to the rail length, and ballasted with cinders, tie plates are
              used on curves The weather was cloudy at the time of the accident,
              which occurred at about 7 05 a.m.<br>
              <br>
              INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION<br>
              <br>
              DESCRIPTION<br>
              <br>
              Southbound passenger train No 91 consisted of one baggage ear,
              two Pullman sleeping cars, one dining car and two Pullman sleeping
              cars, in the order named, hauled by engine 550, and was in charge
              of Conductor Hilley and Engineman Brown The cars were of all-steel
              construction with the exception of the fourth car, which had a
              steel underframe This train left Junta, 19.44 miles from Kennesaw,
              at 6 38 a m, eight minutes late, passed Kennesaw at 7 05 a m, two
              minutes late, and on reaching a point about 650 feet south of the
              station was derailed by a broken rail while traveling at a speed
              estimated to have been between 35 and 40 miles an hour<br>
              <br>
              Engine 550, its tender, the first three cars, and the forward truck
              of the fourth car were derailed to the right, the engine coming
              to rest on its right side on an adjacent passing track, with its
              head end 306 feet from the initial point of derailment, the cars
              remained upright The employee killed was the engineman<br>
              <br>
              SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE<br>
              <br>
              The fist knowledge members of the crew had of anything wrong was
              when the accident occurred Fireman Young stated he noticed nothing
              wrong with the riding qualities of the engine en route, and estimated
              the speed to have been 40 miles an hour at the time of the accident,
              also that the engineman applied the an brakes in emergency just
              after the engine became derailed Conductor Hilley estimated the
              speed to have been about 35 miles an horn at the time of the derailment,
              immediately after the accident he found a broken jail in the track,
              near the dining car.<br>
              <br>
              The rail which broke was on the west side of the track, this being
              the high rail of the curve, the break occurring at a point 11 1/4
              inches from the leaving end, at the end of a space bar. The first
              6 feet of the receiving end of this rail remained intact, but from
              this point to where the break occurred the rail was turned over.
              These were no marks on the north end of the leaving portion of
              the rail, located immediately south of where the break occurred,
              to indicate that any wheels passed over it<br>
              <br>
              Inspection of the track starting at the twenty-second rail joint
              north of the joint where the rail broke, the joints being staggered,
              showed the gauge to be standard on slightly wide, down to and including
              the fifth joint, inclusive, it was one-eighth inch narrow, and
              at the joint immediately adjacent to the broken rail the gauge
              was one-sixteenth inch narrow. The elevation of the outside rail
              on the curve varied from 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 inches.<br>

              Section Foreman Garrett passed over the track at the point of accident
              on his motor car in the afternoon of the day prior to the accident,

              unusual on either occasion. He arrived at the scene of accident
              shortly after its occurrence and on examining the track found no

              Southbound passenger train No 3 passed this point less than one

              <br>
              This accident was caused by a broken rail. An investigation into
              the reason for the failure of this rail was conducted by Mr. James
              E Howard, engineer-physicist, whose report immediately follows<br>
              <br>
              REPORT OF THE ENGINEER-PHYSICIST<br>
              <br>
              The derailment of train No. 91, at Kennesaw, Ga, on December 22,
              1923, was due to a broken rail, the high rail of a curve The weight
              of the rail was 90 pounds per yard, section A R E A,-A, ingot letter
              C, heat number 47962 rolled by the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad
              Company, in 1920.<br>
              <br>
              The rail fractured at a distance of 11 3/4 inches from the leaving
              end, in close proximity to the splice bars. The long end was overturned
              outwardly, the flanges of the wheels traveling upon the web at
              the fillet under the head. There were no battering effects from
              the wheels on the fractured surface of the short fragment.<br>
              <br>
              The fracture was one of tension having its origin at the power
              corner of the head on the gauge side of the rail. This circumstances
              indicated that a centrifugal force, or outward nosing of the engine
              was the immediate cause of the fracture, and since the derailed
              wheels passed through the opening in the track without striking
              the facing end of the short fragment that the train was not running
              at a high rate of speed<br>
              <br>
              The fractured surfaces showed no defect in the steel, nor was it
              a fracture of a progressive type Rupture began at the lower corner
              of the flange-worn side of the head where the metal had been embrittled
              by the action of the flanges of the wheels.<br>
              <br>
              The longer fragment of the rail was sent to the shops of the N,
              C &amp; St L Ry, at Nashville, Tenn, where bending tests were made
              upon it The rail was placed upon supports 36 inches apart and loaded
              at the middle, in three position First, sidewise, with the outside
              of the head in tension. In this position it showed ample toughtness
              of the metal, taking a deflection set of 4 inches on a chord of
              36 inches, without fracture.<br>
              <br>
              The second test was made also in sidewise direction but with the
              gauge side of the head in tension. In this position the rail fractured
              in a brittle manner without the display of measurable ductility.
              The origin of rupture was at the lower corner of the head, gauge
              side. It was in the same part of the rail as the original fracture
              made at the time of the derailment.<br>
              <br>
              The third test was made with the running surface of the head on
              the tension side. Brittleness was displayed in this fracture. The
              origin was at the lower corner of the head, gauge side, as before.
              A portion of the fractured surface located next the running surface
              of the head, having a depth about one-sixteenth of an inch, showed
              on oblique shearing fracture. This is a common feature in the fracture
              of rails which have been in the track and exposed to the cold rolling
              effects of wheels pressures. Early illustrations of this kind are
              matters of record.<br>
              <br>
              A fourth test was undertaken with the rail in upright position
              applying the load on the top of the head, the base being in tension
              Injury occurred to the bending press and this test was discontinued
              without rupture of the rail<br>
              <br>
              Chemical analyses of the steel, in two placed, at the corner of
              the head and at the junction of the head and web, gave the following
              results.<br>

              <br>
              Macroscopic and microscopic examination was made of the rail on
              a section taken from the leaving end, from the immediate vicinity
              of the fractured surface Figure 1 shows the appearance of the fractured
              surface at the leaving end the incipient point of rupture was at
              the lower corner of the head on the gauge side, at the place marked
              by a star on the cut. From this initial point the plane of rupture
              extended across the head, thence downward through the web and the
              base, ending at the edges of the flanges. An oblique shearing of
              fracture, as previously mentioned, was displayed by the metal adjacent
              to the running surface, representing the cold rolling effects of
              the wheel pressures.<br>
              <br>
              The fractured surface of the leaving end was battered in a few
              placed, al of which were secondary effects. The flanges of the
              wheels bruised the metal at the fillet under the head after the
              rail was overturned. The radiant, tan like, appearance of the fractured
              surface indicated its point of origin. In the fracture of steel
              the plane of rupture had it origin and extends from the center
              of radiation. This simple and reliable method of judging of the
              incipient point of rupture should be familiar to all. Its observance
              would obviate many erroneous conjectures concerning the cause of
              rail failures. In the present instance the cause of fractured had
              erroneously been attributed to flaws and defects in the steel where
              none existed, in three different placed none of which had a relation
              to the incipient point of rupture.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 2 represents a sulphur print of the cross section of the
              rail, near the fractured and. The uniformly of the metal is almost
              phenomenal. No adverse criticism attaches to the rail respecting
              its composition of structure.<br>
              <br>
              Flange wear was shown incident to its portion as a high rail on
              a curve but not of unusual amount. All parts of the periphery of
              the head, exposed to contact with the treads and flanges of wheels
              are modified in structure, strength, and ductility. Different effects,
              however, are experienced at different parts of the of the running
              surface. At the outer part of the head the meal is crowded outward,
              laterally Median metal is flattened. Lateral flow occurs on the
              gauge side half of the head, arrested somewhat by the fillets of
              the wheels. The flanges of the wheels cause flow and shearing of
              the metal down the gauge side.<br>
              <br>
              A profound disturbance of the metal in the top of the head of the
              rail results from the action of the wheels. It is important that
              this fact be recognized, since it constitutes the clux of the rail
              problem. The manner of failure of rails leads to this conclusion.<br>
              <br>
              Photomicrograph, Figure 3, shows the distorted shape of the grain
              of the metal at the lower corner of the head, gauge side, at the
              place indicated by the star on Figure 1. The original toughness
              of the steel was destroyed by the action of the flanges of the
              wheels. The brittleness by the rail at the time of derailment,
              as well as the subsequent tests, testify to this feature.<br>
              <br>
              Photomicrograph, Figure 4, represents the metal on the gauge side
              of the head, at mid-depth. The metal in this vicinity was sheared
              off by the wheel flanges, with slight disturbance below the abraded
              surface.<br>
              <br>
              Photomicrograph, Figure 5, shows the flattened structure and downward
              flow of the metal at the upper corner of the head, gauge side.
              The normal structure of the metal, in unaffected parts of the cross
              section, is shown by Figure 6. Each of these photomicrographs represent
              transverse sections at a magnification of 100 diameters.<br>
              <br>
              Since the origin of rupture was on the gauge side of the head it
              signified that that part of the rail was exposed to a strain of
              tension at the time of rupture. The gauge side of the head is not
              ordinarily put into a high state of tension. Under vertical leads
              it is in compression. The presence of a horizontal force is needed
              to account for such a rupture as witnesses on this occasion. The
              nosing of engines causes strains of this kind and furnishes the
              most plausible explanation of the fracture, the section of the
              rail in front of the engine being the part put into a state of
              tension.<br>
              <br>
              On tangent track irregularities in alignment have been responsible
              for fractures of this kind. The *** state of the surface metal
              and the relatively small section modulus of the rail in lateral
              direction, each facilitate rupture in a sidewise direction. Excess
              speed was not a factor in this case.<br>
              <br>
              The behavior of the derailed engine on this run was satisfactory.
              It had traversed a considerable part of the curve without any untoward
              circumstances when the derailment took place. By the process of
              elimination responsibility for the fracture of the rail appears
              to attach to track conditions in that particular locality which
              would lead to severe nosing of the engine. It satisfies all that
              is known about the derailment to assume that an unusual outward
              thrust was exerted upon the rail by the engine as the leaving end
              was being approached. Lateral reenforcement was given the rail
              by the splice bars at its leaving end.<br>
              <br>
              Considering the part of the rail embraced by the splice bars as
              a fixed end and the receiving end of the rail as the long aim of
              a lever, then the application of a sufficient outward thrust on
              the long arm would rupture the rail. It is believed the present
              rail was ruptured in substantially the manner just described.<br>
              <br>
              The behavior of another rail will be described, which also ruptured
              by reason of a state of hardness and brittleness acquired from
              the action of the wheels, wheel burning, in fact, appearing as
              the chief factor.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 7 illustrates the fractures surface of this rail, a rail
              of 100 pounds weight per yard, which displayed head checks in service
              Head checks were numerous on the rail-embryonic, and those of advanced
              stage of development. The appeared on the running surface, gauge
              side of the head. The head check here illustrated was one inch
              long by five-sixteenths inch deep.<br>
              <br>
              A series of photomicrographs shows the appearance of the metal
              next the running surface of the head. These photomicrographs, all
              of 100 diameters magnification, show hardening of the metal at
              the immediate surface, with flattening of the grains of the steel
              in adjacent parts of the cross section and normal structure below
              the affected metal.<br>
              <br>
              Photomicrograph, Figure 8, shows the appearance of the metal at
              the running surface near the outside corner of the head. There
              was a hardened layer of surface metal with flattened grains next
              below, showing an outward flow of the metal, that is, toward the
              outside edge of the head.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 9 shows more of the metal with flattened grains, located
              next below the zone illustrated by Figure 8. The dip of the flattened
              grains toward the outside edge of the head is conspicuously shown.
              The normal structure of the steel is shown by Figure 10.<br>
              <br>
              A rearrangement of the structural state of the metal is accomplished
              by annealing. Figure 11 shows the modified structure after annealing
              at 1,475 degrees F, its appearance before annealing being shown
              by Figure 9.<br>
              <br>
              Along a median zone the structural condition of the meal is less
              changed by the wheel pressures. Figure 12 shows the metal at the
              running surface at the middle of the width of the head. There was
              slight hardening, of the metal at the surface with a shallow zone
              of flattened grains Figures 8 to 12, inclusive, represent transverse
              sections.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 13 shows a longitudinal section of the head at the running
              surface near the upper corner, gauge side. Figure 14, also a longitudinal
              section, represents the metal next below Figure 13. Hardened and
              cracked surface metal is shown by these two cuts, with outlines
              of grain structure retained within the hardened zone and with a
              sharp line of demarcation between hardened metal and that of normal
              structure.<br>
              <br>
              Figures 15 and 16 car transverse sections and represent the metal
              at the running surface near the upper corner of the head, gauge
              side. They further illustrate the appearance of the hardened surface
              metal, converted from metal of normal structure.<br>
              <br>
              Each of these two rails show the destructive effects of wheel pressures.
              In the first rail there was exhaustion of toughness unaccompanied
              by thermal effects. In the second rail conditions of service involving
              thermal effects caused hardening of the metal. Each showed affected
              zones of metal of distorted grain structure. Track conditions were
              responsible for these structural changes. It will be recognized
              that manufacturing conditions were not responsible for the fractures
              of these rails. Fractures of these types occur in steel rails of
              good quality. Immunity from these effects of track conditions is
              not attained through choice of grade of steel employed.<br>
              <br>
              In conclusion, the present derailment was caused by the fracture
              of a rail, the high rail of a curve. The origin of fracture was
              at the lower corner of the head, on the gauge side. At that place
              the metal was embrittled, the result of flange action of the wheels.
              The rail showed moderate flange wear, common to high rails.<br>
              <br>
              It was a tension fracture, and since it occurred on the gauge side
              of the head it represented an outward thrust on the rail at one
              part of its length while another part was firmly held. Occurring
              as it did abreast the ends of the splice bars, it is inferred that
              an outward thrust occurred at a short distance from the splice
              bars.<br>
              <br>
              The engine was derailed and apparently passed through the opening
              in the track made by the broken rail, and without injury to the
              facing end of the short fragment of the rail. Judging from the
              known circumstances, it is believed that the outward thrust which
              caused the fracture came from the engine. That nosing of the engine
              broke the rail. Furthermore, since the engine had traversed a portion
              of the curve, that responsibility for its nosing at that particular
              place was due to a local condition of the track. Speed was surely
              not a factor in the case.<br>
              <br>
              Embrittlement of the metal of the rail resulted from the action
              of the flanges of the wheels. The composition of the steel and
              its structural state, where not affected by service conditions,
              was good.<br>
              <br>
              Fracture occurred, it is believed, a little in front of the engine
              due to its nosing and that track conditions were mainly responsible
              for the nosing.<br>
              <br>
              The examination of another rail is included in this report, in
              which wheel burning led to the development of head checks.<br>
              <br>
              SUMMARY<br>
              <br>
              The investigation of this accident showed that a broken rail, the
              high rail of the curve, was responsible for the derailment. The
              circumstances of the case also showed that high speed was not a
              factor. An outward force of some kind was applied of sufficient
              degree to break the rail.<br>
              <br>
              Two principal features are brought out in the investigation made
              by the engineer-physicist, namely, a state of brittleness in the
              rail on the gauge side of the head, attributed to the flange action
              of the wheels, whereby there was loss in strength and ductility
              in the steel. Furthermore, that while nosing of the engine was
              the proximate cause of rupture that local track conditions were
              responsible for the excessive nosing required to effect rupture.<br>
              <br>
              The metal of the rail was of good quality where not affected by
              wheel pressures. The cause of fracture arrived at appears consistent
              with the known circumstances of the derailment, and appears the

              No unsatisfactorily behavior of the engine was noticed on this
              run which would account for unusual nosing. While the metal of
              the rail was embrittled, nevertheless a severe lateral thrust was
              needed to effect is rupture. The condition of the engine and speed
              as factors being eliminated, local track conditions alone remain
              as the responsible cause for the derailment.<br>
