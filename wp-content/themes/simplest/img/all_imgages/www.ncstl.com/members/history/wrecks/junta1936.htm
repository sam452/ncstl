              Railroad:	Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis<br>
              Date:	August 9, 1936<br>

              Train involved:	Freight<br>
              Train number:	Extra 657<br>
              Engine number:	657<br>
              Consist:	33 cars, caboose<br>
              Speed:	4-6 m.p.h.<br>
              Track: 2 degrees 26 curve; accident occurred at north switch of
              passing truck; descending grade northward<br>
              Weather:	Cloudy and dark<br>
              Time:	1:55 a.m.<br>
              Casualties:	1 killed<br>
              Cause: Loaded coal car did not couple to cars of train left standing
              on main track when it was backed against them, following which
              it rolled down grade and cornered box car being set off on passing
            track</p>
            <p>              September 19, 1936.</p>
            <p>To the Commission:</p>
            <p>              On August 9, 1936, there was a side collision between a loaded
              coal car and a box car which was being set off on the passing track
              of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway at Junta,
            Ga., which resulted in the death of one employee.</p>
            <p><strong>              Location and method of operation</strong></p>
            <p>              This accident occurred on the Atlanta Division, which extends between
              Atlanta, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance of 136.55 miles;
              in the vicinity of the point of accident this is a single-track
              line over which trains are operated by timetable, train orders
              and an automatic block-signal system. The accident occurred at
              the frog of the north switch of the passing track at Junta; the
              passing track parallels the main track on the east, with a high
              switch stand on the east side of the north switch, the point of
              frog being located 76 feet south of the point of switch. Approaching
              from the south the track is tangent for about 1,000 feet, followed
              by a 2 degrees 26 curve to the left 1,480 feet in length; the accident
              occurred on this curve at a point 126 feet from its southern end.
              The grade on the main track at the point where the forward end
              of the train stood, is 0.65 percent descending northward.<br>
              In the vicinity of the north switch of the passing track the view
              is unobstructed; it was dark and the weather was cloudy at the
            time of the accident, which occurred about 1:55 a.m.</p>
            <p><strong>              Description</strong></p>
            <p>              Extra 657, a north-bound freight train, consisted at the time of
              the accident of 33 cars and a caboose, hauled by engine 657, and
              was in charge of Conductor Kerr and Engineman Barton. This train
              left Atlanta, 47.81 miles south of Junta, at 12:01 a.m., according
              to the train sheet, and arrived at Junta at 1:49 a.m., stopping
              on the main track just south of the north switch of the passing
              track. The first car in the train, R.I. 157998, a steel underframe
              box car with wooden body and metal corrugated ends, was to be set
              off on the passing track, and a car of coal, L. &amp; N. 87437,
              an all-steel hopper car, was to be picked up. Brakeman Evans uncoupled
              the first car from the train and the engine backed it into the
              siding where it was coupled to the car of coal, following which
              both cars were backed against the train; the car of coal did not
              couple to the train, but as the brakeman was not aware of this
              he uncoupled the box car and it was pulled northward over the switch.
              The switch was then lined for the passing track, and the brakeman
              climbed the end ladder on the south end of the box car, preparatory
              to setting the hand brake. As the engine was backing the box car
              through the switch at a speed of about 4 or 6 miles per hour, the
              southwest corner of the box car was struck by the north end of
            the coal car, which had rolled away from the train.</p>
            <p><strong>              Diagram</strong></p>
            <p> Inv. No. 2090 Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Ry. Junta,
              Ga. Aug. 9, 1936<br>
              The ends of both cars were damaged, and the rear truck of the box
              car was derailed. The employee killed was the brakeman.            </p>
            <p><strong>Summary of evidence </strong> </p>
            <p> Engineman Barton stated that Brakeman Evans was on the engine
              on arrival at Junta; the train was stopped on the main track with
              the engine about 2 or 3 car lengths south of the north switch of
              the passing track. The brakeman made a cut behind the first car
              in the train, and it was pulled ahead and backed into the passing
              track and coupled to L.&amp;N. hopper 87437. Both cars were then
              backed against the train with sufficient force to make a coupling
              and the engineman thought the coupling was made. The brakeman then
              made a cut behind the box car and it was pulled ahead to clear
              the switch, then backed into the siding. It was dark and cloudy
              but the Engineman saw the signals given by the brakeman. After
              handling the switch for this movement the brakeman gave another
              back-up signal to the fireman, then climbed the ladder on the south
              end of the car. While backing in on the passing track, at a speed
              of about 4 or 5 miles per hour, the box car obscured the enginemans
              view of the cars on the main track. He did not know that the coal
              car had failed to make the coupling before it cornered the box
              car; he immediately applied the air brakes. Brakeman Evans later
              told the engineman that he saw the coal car approaching and had
              made an attempt to get out of the way but was unable to do so.
              Engineman Barton said that the air brakes were tested and worked
              properly. After the accident he did not inspect the coupler on
              the south end of L.&amp;N. 87437, to see whether the knuckle was
              open or closed. Fireman Head gave testimony similar to that of
              Engineman Barton and said that he was also unaware that the cars
            had failed to couple.</p>
            <p>              Conductor Kerr and Brakeman McHan were at the rear end of the train
              and were not aware of anything wrong until the engineman sounded
              the whistle to call the conductor ahead. The truck of the box car
              was later rerailed and both cars were placed on the passing track,
              following which the tender of the engine was coupled to the head
              car of the train and the train departed; nothing was wrong with
              the north coupler of the head car and no trouble was experienced
              in making the coupling; the conductor examined the drawhead of
              that car and found it to be all right. The conductor did not know
              the position of the knuckles on either the coal car or the adjoining
              carat the time the coal car was backed against the train, but he
              did know that they worked all right. Brakeman McHan said that after
              the accident he noticed that the coupler on the head end of the
              first car in the train standing on the main track was open, and
              he also said that no trouble was later experienced when coupling
              the tender of the engine to this car and that the curve on which
              the train stood was not sufficient to interfere with the coupling.
              He said that an experienced employee can tell by the sound whether
              or not a coupling is made. Brakeman McHan could not account for
              the failure of the coal car to couple when it was backed against
              the train.            </p>
            <p>Car Inspector Kitchens stated that he inspected L. &amp; N. hopper
              87437 as it stood coupled to some other cars on the passing track
              at Junta, at about 4 p.m. on the day prior to the accident, the
              knuckle on the south end not being open at this time; he did not
              find anything wrong. After the accident he again inspected this
              car at this point, the two cars involved having been left coupled
              on the passing track, but found no defects except those caused
              by the accident. He made a special inspection of the coupler on
              the south end of L.&amp;N. 87437, and found it to be all right,
              and the knuckle worked properly; he also measured the height of
            the coupler and it was within the prescribed limits.</p>
            <p>              General Car Foreman Carman made a careful inspection
              of the two damaged cars involved in the accident as they stood
              coupled on
                the passing track at Junta after the accident. Apparently when
                the collision occurred the coupler on the north end of the hopper
                car passed under the end sill of the box car, and the coupler
                  on the box car struck the end sill of the hopper car, shoving
                  it back
                from 12 to 14 inches, and evidently causing the rear truck of
                  the box car to become derailed. The only damage resulting to
                  the couplers
                was that the operating levers on both cars were knocked off and
                the knuckle lock-lift was broken off on the hopper car, Inspection
                of the couplers on the opposite ends of the damaged cars showed
                them to be in good condition and of proper height, and there
                  were no defects on these cars except those which were caused
                  by the
              accident.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
            <p> On arrival of Extra 657 at Junta the train stopped on the main
                    track with the engine about two or three car lengths south
                    of the north switch of the passing track, on a slight grade
                    descending
                    northward. The first car in the train was to be set out and
                    a car
                    which stood on the passing track was to be picked up. Brakeman
                    Evans made a cut behind the first car and the engine then
              backed that car in upon the passing track and coupled to the coal
                    car, after which both cars were backed against the standing
                    train
                    with sufficient force to make a coupling. The brakeman then
                    made a cut
                    behind the box car in order to set it on the passing track,
                    following which he handled the switch and gave signals to
              the
                    engine crew
                    to back into the passing track, without first having definitely
                    ascertained whether the coal car had coupled to the cars
              standing on the main track. The brakeman rode on the ladder on
              the south
                    end of the box car while it was being backed into the passing
                    track and he did not see the car rolling down the main track
                    until it
                    was but a short distance away; he tried to get out of the
              way, but was unable to do so. Inspection of the couplers involved,
                    both before and after the accident, failed to disclose anything
                    wrong
                    with them; the reason for their failure to couple when the
                    loaded coal car was backed against the north car of the train
                    standing
                  on the main track was not determined.</p>
            <p><strong>              Conclusion</strong>              </p>
            <p>This accident was caused by the failure of a brakeman to ascertain
                that a coupling had been made between a car which was picked
            up and the train against which it was placed.</p>
