            <p>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION</p>
            <p>REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION 
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE TERMINALS OF THE 
              LOUISVILLE AND NASHVILLE RAILROAD AND THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA 
              AND ST. LOUIS RAILROAD AT NASHVILLE, TENN., ON JULY 31, 1923.</p>
            <p>September 11, 1923.</p>
            <p>To the Commission:</p>
            <p>On July 31, 1923, there was a derailment of a yard engine on the 
              Nashville Terminals at Nashville, Tenn., the derailed engine colliding 
              with a freight train on an adjoining track, resulting in the death 
              of three employees and the injury of five employees.</p>
            <p>Location and method of operation.</p>
            <p>The Nashville Terminals consist of Kayne Avenue Yard and a number 
              of outlying yards, including the shops of the Nashville, Chattanooga 
              and St. Louis Railroad, about 2 miles north of Kayne Avenue Yard, 
              and the West Nashville Yard, located on a branch line about 2 1/2 
              miles beyond Shops. The accident occurred about one-half mile north 
              of the north and of Kayne Avenue Yard, and about 500 feet south 
              of, and within the limits of the Eleventh Avenue interlocking plant; 
              in the vicinity of the point of accident this is a double-track 
              line over which trains are operated by timetable, train orders, 
              and a manual block-signal system. Approaching from the north the 
              track is tangent for 1,622 feet, followed by a compound curve to 
              the right varying from 1 degree 20 to 7 degree 28, which is 1,697 
              feet in length, being 5 degree 50 at the point of derailment, and 
              then is tangent to the south for 1,660 feet. The grade descends 
              to the south for over 2 miles to a point about 600 feet north of 
              the point of accident, varying from 1.04 to 1.32 per cent, then 
              is ascending to Kayne Avenue Yard, varying from 0.39 to 1.17 per 
              cent, being 0.52 per cent at the point of accident. The track is 
              laid on a fill 20 feet in height, with 90-pound rails, 33 feet in 
              length, with 18 to 20 ties to the rail length, tie plated, ballasted 
              with stone and gravel, and maintained in good condition. The weather 
              was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred at 10.43 p.m.</p>
            <p>Description.</p>
            <p>Yard engine 629, in charge of Foreman Simpson and Engineman Ashburn, 
              left West Nashville Yard with 24 cars at 10.10 p.m., and was derailed 
              near the south limit of the Eleventh Avenue interlocking plant at 
              10.43 p.m., on account of a car door lying on the left rail of the 
              southbound track, the engine swerving toward the left or outside 
              of the curve and colliding with the engine of northbound freight 
              train No. 50, while running at a speed estimated to have been between 
              6 and 25 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>Northbound freight train No. 50 consisted of 31 cars and a caboose, 
              hauled by engine 622, and was in charge of Conductor Mason and Engineman 
              Smith. It left Kayne Avenue Yard at 10.35 p.m., and while running 
              at a speed estimated to have been 15 or 20 miles an hour was struck 
              by yard engine 629.</p>
            <p>From the point at which the car door was found on the southbound 
              track, flange marks appeared on top of the rails extending southward 
              34.25 feet, then on the ties on the east side of the rails for a 
              distance of 75.33 feet to the frog of a trailing crossover switch 
              where the wheels again mounted the rails; from this frog, flange 
              marks appeared at intervals for a distance of 83.58 feet to the 
              frog of a trailing point switch, where engine 629 was overturned 
              and with its tender came to rest down the west bank of the fill 
              with its ends reversed. Engine 622, together with its tender, was 
              overturned and came to rest down the east bank of the fill. Twelve 
              cars were derailed and more or less badly damaged. The employees 
              killed were the conductor, engineman and head brakeman of train 
              No. 50.</p>
            <p>Summary of evidence.</p>
            <p>Switchman Madden, of yard engine 629, stated that he tested the 
              air brakes before his train left West Nashville Yard and found the 
              air brakes on two of the 24 cars inoperative. After leaving Shops, 
              where a helper engine was detached, he rode in the gangway of the 
              engine on the enginemans side. He stated that the engine drifted 
              nearly the entire distance from Shops to the point of accident, 
              and at no time was the speed in excess of 15 miles an hour, two 
              airbrake applications being made on the descending grade, and when 
              a short distance south of the Eleventh Avenue Tower he saw the headlight 
              of a northbound train and at about the same time saw an object on 
              the southbound track about 2 1/2 car lengths ahead of his engine 
              and shouted to the engineman, who applied the air brakes, reducing 
              the speed to about 6 miles an hour and when the engine began to 
              rock, he jumped before the collision occurred. He stated that about 
              15 minutes later he went back to ascertain the cause of the derailment 
              and found a car door lying between the tracks and across the east 
              rail of the southbound track, with about 2 feet of the corner cut 
              off, this being about four car lengths north of the point where 
              the engines collided. Switchman Malone stated he rode the top of 
              the last car and estimated the speed at the time of the accident 
              at 20 to 25 miles an hour. Fireman McKee said he was putting in 
              a fire when the engine began to rock and he felt the impact of the 
              collision, but he was unable to say whether or not the engineman 
              was working steam or estimate the speed at the time of the accident. 
              Owing to injuries sustained, the statements of Foreman Simpson and 
              Engineman Ashburn could not be obtained at the time this investigation 
              was held.</p>
            <p>Fireman Henry, of train No. 50, stated that his train left Kayne 
              Avenue Yard at 10.35 p.m., Conductor Mason and Brakeman Thrasher 
              riding on the engine. On nearing the Eleventh Avenue Tower, running 
              at a speed of about 15 miles per hour, from his position in the 
              firemans cab he saw the headlight of engine 629 and after calling 
              the position of a signal to the engineman, who began to work steam, 
              he got down to throw in a fire; at about this time the brakeman 
              shouted a warning and he did not think the engineman had time to 
              apply the brakes before the engine seemed to raise up and then turn 
              over. Flagman Ament said he was riding inside the caboose and the 
              train had just cleared the yard lead track when it stopped suddenly 
              while running at a speed of about 15 or 20 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>Car Foreman Melody stated he arrived at the scent of the accident 
              at 11.20 p.m., and after the rest cars of engine 629 had been pulled 
              back he found a car door lying between the tracks about 7 car lengths 
              north of the point where engine 629 came to rest, one corner of 
              the door having been clipped off by the east rail of the southbound 
              track, the outside portion of the door being underneath and from 
              the stenciling he identified it as belonging to Louisville and Nashville 
              car 3298. He also stated that he noticed flange marks on the rails 
              to a point where the engine went on the ground and concluded that 
              the derailment was due to engine 629 running over the car door, 
              which apparently had fallen from the west side of a car passing 
              in a northbound train. He stated that the door was of pine, of the 
              Waggoner type, 68 inches wide and 85 inches high, single board construction, 
              with three 10-inch battens applied horizontally, at the top, center 
              and bottom, the sides braced the full height, making a maximum thickness 
              of 1 5/8 inches, the remaining portion of single sheave tongue and 
              groove construction, being 13/16 inch wide. Later the door was rehung 
              on the car and it was found that the door rod shoes were not intact 
              but he expressed the belief that the shoes were in place before 
              the car was moved else it would have fallen off in switching operations, 
              and he concluded that the door fell off by reason of a shock which 
              permitted the door rod shoes to disengage themselves from the door 
              track.</p>
            <p>Assistant Superintendent Hamilton stated that Louisville and Nashville 
              car 3298 was received empty from the Tennessee Central Railroad 
              on the interchange track at 10 a.m., July 31. and after inspection 
              was accepted and moved from South Nashville Yard to Kayne Avenue 
              Yard at 4.05 p.m., destined to West Nashville for loading, at which 
              point it was classified over the yard hump onto track 13 and later 
              classified over the hump onto track 36. At 10.25 p.m., yard engine 
              458 pulled 8 cars off track 36, including the car in question, and 
              moved to West Nashville Yard.</p>
            <p>Car Inspector Burkitt stated he made an inspection of this car 
              on the interchange track and opened the door on the west side wide 
              enough to permit him to enter the car; finding no defects, he took 
              no exception to the car. He stated that he did not close the car 
              door, as it was not the practice when a car was to be handled in 
              a city movement. He also inspected the car and door after the accident 
              and found nothing defective about them. Car Inspectors Moon and 
              Donavon stated they inspected the cars standing on track 36, Kayne 
              Avenue Yard, between 3.35 and 4.15 p.m., and found nothing defective 
              on any of the cars on that track when their inspection was made.</p>
            <p>Towerman Carter stated he was on his way to work and about 8 or 
              10 car lengths from the tower when yard engine 629 with a cut of 
              cars passed southbound at a speed of about 18 or 20 miles an hour, 
              previous to which he had noticed yard engine 458 with a cut of cars 
              going northbound, and a short time later he heard the noise of a 
              collision. On his way to the scene of the accident he saw a car 
              door lying between the tracks about 15 car lengths south of the 
              rear of the train hauled by yard engine 629. Towerman Naylor, on 
              duty at Eleventh Avenue Tower, said yard engine 458 passed northbound 
              at 10.30 p.m., and a few minutes later he saw a northbound freight 
              coming, moving at a speed of about 20 miles an hour and secured 
              a block for it, and shortly afterwards heard the noise of the collision.</p>
            <p>Foreman Wyatt, of yard engine 458, said his engine left track 36, 
              the engine headed south, backing with 8 cars, about 10.30 p.m., 
              to run to West Nashville Yard, previous to which he had checked 
              the cars for numbers and seals, and while he did net inspect the 
              cars he saw that one or Two of the doors of the cars were open and 
              from his book record he identified Louisville and Nashville car 
              3298 as being the seventh car in the cut but he did not recall whether 
              or not the door on this car was open. He estimated the speed of 
              the cut passing Eleventh Avenue Tower at 6 or 8 miles an hour and 
              from his position on top of the tank he did not see any obstruction 
              on the southbound track nor did he make any cheek or inspection 
              of the cars on arrival at West Nashville Yard. Switchman Frazier. 
              who rode the top of the tank, and Switchman Phipps, who rode the 
              top of the rear car, said they did not notice any obstruction or, 
              the southbound track, while the latter said that he had walked along 
              the west side of the cars coupling the air hose and noticed nothing 
              defective about the cars or doors.</p>
            <p>Conclusions.</p>
            <p>This accident was caused by engine 629 striking a car door which 
              had fallen on the track from a car moved on an adjacent track.</p>
            <p>The investigation developed that there gas nothing wrong with the 
              track or equipment of the trains involved, out that the door of 
              Louisville and Nashville car 3298 fell from the car as it gas passing 
              in a cut of cars attached to northbound yard engine 458, falling 
              between the tracks and across the east rail of the southbound track 
              and being run over by yard engine 629. Although no statement could 
              be obtained from Engineman Ashburn of yard engine 629, the fact 
              that the obstruction was on a curve probably accounts for his failure 
              to see it in time to stop; it is also believed that the speed was 
              considerably higher than the average of 10 miles an hour allowed 
              under a time-table rule which requires southbound trains to use 
              not less than 15 minutes from Shops Tower to Kayne Avenue South 
              Yard, a distance of about 2 1/2 miles.</p>
            <p>The inspectors who inspected this car while it was on yard track 
              36 found nothing wrong, but it seems probable that the door became 
              disengaged from its track in one of the hump movements, resulting 
              in its falling off when the car rounded the first curve after leaving 
              the yard. Undoubtedly careful inspection prior to the movement of 
              the car from Kayne Avenue Yard would have disclosed the defect, 
              and the making of the proper repairs would have prevented the occurrence 
              of this accident. These terminals are of considerable size, and 
              the inter-yard hauls are frequently of considerable length; this 
              accident emphasizes the need of giving cars so handled a thorough 
              inspection and proper correction of existing defects before undertaking 
              their movement.</p>
            <p>The crew of yard engine 629 had been on duty about 7 hours and 
              the crew of train No. 50 less than 1 hour, previous to which all 
              of these employees had been off duty from 14 to 53 hours.</p>
