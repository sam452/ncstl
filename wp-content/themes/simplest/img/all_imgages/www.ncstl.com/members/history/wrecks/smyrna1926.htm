            <p>REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST.
              LOUIS RAILWAY AT SMYRNA, TENN. ON MAY 5, 1926.</p>
            <p>July 23, 1926.</p>
            <p>To the Commission:</p>
            <p>On May 5, l926, there was a head-end collision between two passenger
              trains on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway at
              Smyrna, Tenn., resulting in the death of one employee, and the
              injury of seven employees and two mail clerks.</p>
            <p><strong>Location and method of operation</strong></p>
            <p>This accident occurred on that part of the Chattanooga Division
              extending between Nashville and Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance
              of 151.72 miles; in the vicinity of the point of accident this
              is a single-track line over which trains are operated by time-table
              and train orders, no block-signal system being in use. Smyrna is
              located 20.19 miles south of Nashville; the passing track at Smyrna
              is 3,180.3 feet in length, and the accident occurred between the
              switches of the passing track, on the main track, at a point 392
              feet north of the south switch. Approaching the point of accident
              from either direction the track is tangent for a considerable distance,
              while the grade is 1.01 per cent descending for northbound trains
              almost to the point of accident, from which point it is practically
              level to and beyond the station, which is located west of the tracks
              and almost midway between the switches of the passing track.</p>
            <p>The weather was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred
              at about 3.51 p.m.</p>
            <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
            <p>Southbound passenger train No. 5 consisted ok one mail car, one
              baggage car, and three coaches, hauled by engine 511, and was in
              charge of Conductor Sutton and Engineman McKeand. At Lavergne,
              4.46 miles north of Smyrna, a train order was received, containing
              instructions to meet train No. 96 at Smyrna. Train No. 5 arrived
              at Smyrna at 3.48 p.m., on time; after completing station work
              it proceeded down the main track at a speed of about 3 or 4 miles
              an hour and had reached a point 392 feet north of the south switch
              of the passing track when it collided with train No. 96.</p>
            <p>Northbound passenger train No. 96 consisted of three express cars,
              two mail cars, and one combination passenger and baggage car, hauled
              by engine 533, and was in charge of Conductor Montgomery and Engineman
              Burns. At Murfreesboro, 11.48 miles south of Smyrna, copy of train
              order No. 94, Form 31, was received reading as follows:</p>
            <p>&quot;No 5 engine 511 meet No 96 engine 533 at Smyrna&quot;</p>
            <p>Train No. 96 departed from Murfreesboro, the last open office,
              at 3.37 p.m., five minutes late, and on reaching Smyrna. instead
              of heading in at the south switch of the passing track, as required,
              being the inferior train by direction. it continued northward on
              the main track and collided with train No. 5 while traveling at
              a speed variously estimated to have been between 20 and 45 miles
              an hour.</p>
            <p>Both engines and their tenders were derailed and badly damaged,
              but none of the cars in either train was derailed or materially
              damaged. The employee killed was the fireman of train No. 5.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary of evidence</strong></p>
            <p>Engineman Burns, of train No. 96, stated that engines were changed
              at Chattanooga and after engine 533 was coupled to his train Assistant
              Traveling Engineer Neal oiled one side of it and that he oiled
              the other. He did not know whether or not the air brakes were tested
              at this point but said he made inquiry and was informed that all
              the air brakes were working, while no trouble was experienced in
              making the various stops and slow downs en route to Smyrna, m distance
              of 131.53 miles. At Murfreesboro he received a copy of train order
              No. 94 and thoroughly understood that his train was required to
              take the siding for train No. 5 at Smyrna. Approaching Florence,
              5.31 miles south of Smyrna, the section foreman had a flag out
              and the speed of the train was reduced to about 5 or 6 miles an
              hour while passing over the section of track under repair. He sounded
              the station signal when approaching Smyrna and on reaching a point
              about one car-length south of a public road crossing, located 1,311
              feet south of the south switch of the passing track, he made about
              a 10-pound air brake reduction, at which time the gauge registered
              full brake-pipe and main-reservoir pressures. When at a point about
              half way between the road crossing and the switch he noticed that
              the speed of his train was increasing and moved the brake valve
              handle to the emergency position, reducing the speed to about 15
              or 18 miles an hour; he thought the speed was about 15 miles an
              hour when passing the south switch, and said it then increased,
              being about 18 or 20 miles an hour at the time of the collision.
              Engineman Burns further stated that the pump on the engine had
              been working properly that all appurtenances pertaining to the
              air-brake system apparently were in good condition, that ordinarily
              the first air-brake application would have brought the train to
              a stop before reaching the south switch, and that he did not know
              why it did not do so in this case.</p>
            <p>Fireman Smith, of train No. 96, stated that the air brakes were
              tested after changing engines at Chattanooga and worked properly
              en route. The meeting-point whistle signal was sounded approaching
              Smyrna, at the station board, located about one-half or three-fourths
              of a mile south of the south switch, at which time the speed was
              about 50 miles an hour. When the first air-brake application was
              made, just south of the road crossing, the air brakes responded
              but did not seem to take proper effect. in comparison with the
              way they had been holding, and just after passing the road crossing
              Fireman Smith said he remarked to the engineman that they were
              going to run by the switch. Engineman Burns then applied the brakes
              in emergency and opened the sanders; this action resulted in gradually
              reducing the speed until finally Fireman Smith jumped, when just
              north of the south switch, at which time the speed was about 20
              miles an hour. Fireman Smith further stated that he thoroughly
              understood his train was to take siding at Smyrna for train No.
              5 and said the air brakes were applied at the usual place for the
              contemplated stops he could offer no explanation as to why the
              air brakes did not respond properly. The statements of Train Porter
              Westmoreland who was riding on the engine for the purpose of opening
              the south switch, corroborated in substance those of Fireman Smith,
              except that he did not recall an emergency application having been
              made just prior to the accident.</p>
            <p>Conductor Montgomery, of train No. 96, stated that the speed was
              about 45 or 50 miles an hour when a brake application was made,
              just south of the crossing approaching Smyrna and that the speed
              had been reduced to about 18 or 20 miles an hour at the time of
              the collision; he was riding in the rear car of the train and was
              unaware that the air brakes had been applied in emergency. Conductor
              Montgomery could not account for the train not being brought to
              a stop before reaching, the south switch. The statements of Flagman
              Wright practically corroborated those of Conductor Montgomery.</p>
            <p>Assistant Traveling Engineer Neal stated that he rode train No.
              96 as far as Cowan, 67.17 miles south of Smyrna, and up to this
              point no trouble was experienced with the air brakes. nor was any
              complaint registered by Engineman Burns as to the manner in which
              they worked. Between Chattanooga and Cowan the air gauge registered
              130 pounds main-reservoir pressure and 110 pounds brake-pipe pressure.</p>
            <p>Safety Inspector Gordon, an employee of the railroad, who was
              riding on train No. 96 at the time of the accident, stated that
              the speed of the train was between 55 and 60 miles an hour when
              the first air-brake application was made, just south of the road
              crossing, and about 45 or 50 miles an hour when the emergency application
              was made, just south of the south switch. While he did not think
              the speed of train No. 96 was continuously excessive he did think
              that it was high and that the speed limit was exceeded between
              Murfreesboro and Smyrna. After the accident he rode train No. 96
              to Nashville and he said the air brakes on the cars involved in
              the accident worked properly. Inspector Gordon further stated that
              train No. 96 ran by the regular station stop at Murfreesboro a
              distance of about three car-lengths, passing the station telegraph
              office at a speed of about 30 to 35 miles an hour. He was of the
              opinion that the accident was the result of the failure of Engineman
              Burns to apply the air brakes soon enough.</p>
            <p>Engineman McKeand, of train No. 5, stated that after station work
              was completed at Smyrna his train proceeded at a speed of about
              3 or 4 miles an hour toward the clearance point of the passing
              track, to wait for train No. 96 to take the siding. The brakes
              on his train were applied at the time of the collision, while he
              estimated the speed of train No. 96 to have been between 15 and
              20 miles an hours.</p>
            <p>Conductor Sutton, Baggagemaster Collins, Flagman Knight, and Train
              Porter Ready, all of train No. 50, were unaware of anything wrong
              until just prior to the accident, at which time their train was
              proceeding at a low rate of speed toward the clearance point of
              the south switch. Conductor Sutton estimated the speed of train
              No. 96 to have been about 40 miles an hour at the time of the collision,
              and said that his own train was driven backward a distance of about
              12 or 15 feet by the force of the impact; he did not think that
              the air brakes were applied on his train prior to the collision.
              After the accident he examined both trains; the air brakes were
              set on every car in train No. 96 and the angle cooks were in proper
              position. Flagman Knight estimated the speed of train No. 96 to
              have been between 40 and 45 miles an hour on passing the south
              switch.</p>
            <p>Conductor Austin and Engineman Totty, who were in charge of train
              No. 96 at the time it was moved from Smyrna to Nashville after
              the accident, stated that the air brakes on the cars worked properly.</p>
            <p>Head Brakeman Wilson. of southbound third-class train No. 43 said
              his train had stopped on the passing track far enough from the
              south switch to allow train No. 96 to head in at that switch to
              clear train No. 5. Before train No. 96 approached he went to the
              switch for the purpose of opening it for that train, but when he
              saw the rate of speed at which the train was approaching he did
              not open the switch, thinking the train would have more room on
              the main track in which to stop. Brakeman Wilson heard the engineman
              of train No. 96 sound one long and one short blast on the whistle
              before reaching the road crossing, followed by several short blasts
              as a warning to men who were working close to the track, and he
              thought the presence of those men might have diverted the attention
              of the engineman. Brakeman Wilson estimated the speed of train
              No. 96 when passing the switch to have been about 20 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>Statements of various employees were to the effect that the air
              brakes were thoroughly tested and worked properly on train No.
              96 after engine 533 was substituted for engine 552 at Chattanooga,
              and that they also worked properly at the time the cars were moved
              to Nashville after the accident, while when they were tested at
              Nashville nothing wrong was found.</p>
            <p>In company with operating and mechanical officers of the railway,
              the Commission's inspectors conducted tests of various parts of
              the air-brake mechanism of engine 533, but nothing wrong was found.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
            <p>This accident was caused by the failure of Engineman Burns, of
              train No. 96, properly to control the speed of his train approaching
              a meeting point.</p>
            <p>Engineman Burns said he thoroughly understood that his train should
              head in at the south switch of the passing track, but that the
              air brakes did not work properly. The evidence, however, was to
              the effect that the air brakes worked properly before and after
              the collision, and it is believed that Engineman Burns did not
              start to apply the air brakes soon enough for the rate of speed
              at which the train was traveling, and that had he properly controlled
              the speed of his train the accident would not have occurred.</p>
            <p>All of the employees involved were experienced men; at the time
              of the accident none of them had been on duty in violation of any
              of the provisions of the hours of service law.</p>
            <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
            <p>W. P. BORLAND</p>
            <p>Director.</p>
