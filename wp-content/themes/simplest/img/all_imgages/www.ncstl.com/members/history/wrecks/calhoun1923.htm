            <p>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION.</p>
            <p>REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION 
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; 
              ST. LOUIS RAILWAY NEAR CALHOUN, GA., ON FEBRUARY 26, 1923.</p>
            <p>April 5, 1923.</p>
            <p>To the Commission:</p>
            <p>On February 26, 1923, where was a derailment of a passenger train 
              on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway near Calhoun, 
              Ga., which resulted in the death of 1 passenger and 1 employee, 
              and the injury of 24 passengers, 1 mail clerk and 9 employees.</p>
            <p><strong>Location and method of operation.</strong></p>
            <p>This accident occurred on the Atlanta Division, which extends between 
              Atlanta, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance of 136.81 miles, 
              at a point about 1 1/2 miles south of Calhoun. In the vicinity of 
              the point of accident this is a single-track line, over which trains 
              are operated by time-table and train orders, no block signal system 
              being in use. Time-table No. 148 limits the speed of all passenger 
              trains to 50 miles an hour except trains Nos. 94 and 95, which are 
              limited to a speed of 60 miles an hour; the speed on curves between 
              Cartersville and Chattanooga, within which territory this accident 
              occurred is restricted to 45 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>Approaching the point of accident from the south the track is tangent 
              for 1,722.5 feet to bridge 75.3, followed by a curve of 2 degrees 
              58 to the left 900 feet in length, then a tangent 79 feet in length, 
              followed by a curve of 3 degrees 46 to the right 1,209 feet in length; 
              the accident occurring on this curve 387 feet from its southern 
              end and 143 feet north of bridge 76.6, on a low fill at the entrance 
              to a cut, 700 feet long, with banks varying from 15 feet to 40 feet 
              high. The grade from the south is descending for about, 8,100 feet, 
              varying from 0.4 to 0.04 per cent.</p>
            <p>The track in the vicinity of the accident is laid with 90-pound 
              rails, 33 feet in length with an average of 18 creosoted ties under 
              each rail, tie plated and double spiked. River gravel ballast is 
              used mixed at irregular intervals with a little crushed stone; stone 
              ballast was used through the out. For a short distance south of 
              bridge 76.6 there were stretches of open and partly filled track, 
              insufficiently ballasted and poorly drained, and form the bridge 
              northward to the first mark of the derailment, a distance of 143 
              feet, the track was laid on crushed rock but was insufficiently 
              ballasted. The super elevation and gauge at the point of accident 
              were maintained generally in good condition. It had been raining 
              for several hours at the time of the accident, which occurred at 
              about 12.50 p.m.</p>
            <p><strong>Description.</strong></p>
            <p>Northbound passenger train second No. 94 consisted of one baggage 
              car, two coaches, one dining car, seven sleeping cars and one observation 
              car, in the order named, of all-steel construction., except the 
              baggage car, which had a steel underframe, hauled by engine 507 
              and 531, and was in charge of Conductor Butler and Engineman McClain 
              and Henderson. According to the train sheet, this train passed Adairsville, 
              about 8 miles south of the point of accident, at 12.39 p.m., 1 hour 
              and 41 minutes late, and was derailed south of Calhoun while traveling 
              at a speed estimated to have been about 43 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>Engine 507 came to rest with the front driving wheels derailed 
              to the right, 1,146 feet from the point of derailment, and 466 feet 
              north of the point where engine 531, together with its tender, was 
              derailed and overturned on its left side, parallel with the track. 
              The engine truck of engine 531 lay on the ties a few feet north 
              of the engine, the ends reversed and upside down; the tender trucks 
              were about 200 feet south of the tender. The first eight cars and 
              the forward truck of the ninth car were derailed, two of them being 
              entirely overturned. The track was torn up for a distance of about 
              680 feet. The employee killed was the fireman of the second engine.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary of evidence.</strong></p>
            <p>Engineman McClain, of engine 507, said the engine rode smoothly 
              until it reached a point about 10 or 15 feet north of bridge 76.6, 
              when it swerved to the left suddenly and then came back; he looked 
              back, saw ballast flying, and applied the air brakes in emergency 
              and reversed the engine. Fireman Kelly, of engine 507, said the 
              engine seemed to strike a rough place in the track just north of 
              bridge 76.6, and then righted itself, while Traveling Fireman Countryman, 
              who was riding on the engine, said it made two or three bad swings 
              when about two rail lengths south of the bridge; these employees 
              looked back about the time the engineman applied the air brakes 
              in emergency and saw engine 531 turn over. Engineman Henderson, 
              of engine 531, felt his engine swing just as it passed bridge 76.6, 
              and he thought the trailer truck had been derailed; the engine continued 
              to swing for about 20 rail lengths, until the front end was raised 
              up and the lead engine became separated from it, shortly after which 
              the engine turned over. These employees, as well as the conductor 
              and flagman, estimated the speed at from 40 to 45 miles an hour.</p>
            <p>J. H. Carman, general foreman of the car department, and Trainmaster 
              McWhorter, together with Traveling Fireman Countryman, were riding 
              on the train for purposes of general inspection of all conditions. 
              Mr. Carman had inspected the cars before the train departed from 
              Atlanta, and in company with the trainmaster and conductor made 
              another inspection at Rogers, 27.16 miles south of Calhoun; neither 
              of these inspections had disclosed the presence of any defects. 
              The trainmaster and general foreman were riding in the second car 
              at the time of the accident, and had noticed nothing unusual prior 
              to its occurrence.</p>
            <p>Examination of the track showed the first mark of derailment was 
              a flange mark on the web of the gauge side of the outside rail, 
              143 feet north of bridge 76.6; the left driving wheels of engine 
              531 then dropped inside the rail, together with the engine truck, 
              overturning the rail for a distance of over 600 feet, the right 
              driving wheels apparently remaining on the rail until the engine 
              was overturned. Hear the point where engine 531 came to rest the 
              front end of the engine truck became wedged in the track and caused 
              the engine to be raised upward and turn over, the truck coming to 
              a stop a few feet distant. When this occurred, engine 507 became 
              separated from engine 531, and it is probable the violent lateral 
              motion transmitted to it from engine 531 resulted in its forward 
              driving wheels being derailed. There were a few abrasions on the 
              right driving wheels of engine 531, while the outside faces of the 
              left driving wheels indicated that they had been revolving rapidly 
              against the gauge side of the rail; there were also indentations 
              in the frame of the engine where the truck had come in contact with 
              it at the time the truck wedged in the track and caused the engine 
              to rise and overturn. A careful examination was made of the engines 
              and cars involved, but nothing was found which could have contributed 
              toward the accident.</p>
            <p>Examination of the track south of the point of derailment showed 
              that when the track was raised by the section crew there was not 
              enough of the old ballast to fill in between the ties except at 
              occasional point. Approaching the point of accident, the track was 
              open a distance of 66 feet, with not to exceed 2 inches of ballast 
              between the ties; then a few feet of track was well ballasted in 
              front of a landing place for track cars, then 20 feet or more of 
              track was open, followed by 35 feet of partly filled track extending 
              to bridge 76.6; the ballast was foul with slime about the ends of 
              and under the ties, good drainage not being provided. From bridge 
              76.6 northward to and beyond the point of derailment, the track 
              was laid on crushed rock but was insufficiently ballasted between 
              the ties and some ballast still remained at the ends of the ties, 
              having been taken out to facilitate the removal of old ties.</p>
            <p>While not involved in the accident it was noted the near the station 
              at Calhoun, slime oozed up around the ends of the ties when the 
              weight of a man was placed upon them, while within a distance of 
              less than 60 feet six spikes were removed by hand.</p>
            <p>Section Foreman Blankenship said he overhauled the track north 
              of bridge 76.3 about 1,350 feet south of the point of accident, 
              raising the track 3 or 4 inches and renewing ties, completing the 
              work up to bridge 76.6 on February 14; he had no occasion to go 
              back over the work except to raise two or three joints. On February 
              16, he had completed the work up to the point where the rail turned 
              over. This track had held its line and surface for nine days and 
              was in good shape on the morning of the accident, when the foreman 
              said work was discontinued on account of rain. Section Foreman Blankenship 
              said a freight train passed the point where they were working on 
              the morning of the accident, and before going in with his men he 
              inspected the track and removed the caution signs erected before 
              starting work that morning, as he considered the track to be in 
              good shape and that there was no necessity for a speed restriction. 
              After the accident he noticed that the track south of bridge 76.6 
              was about 4 inches out of line, the distance the track was out of 
              line being about two or three rail lengths. Section Foreman Blankenship 
              said he considered the track sufficiently ballasted and filled in 
              between the ties to hold the track in place, and accounted for the 
              accumulation of slime at the ends of and underneath ties to the 
              limestone in the gravel ballast, which had been deposited at the 
              time of a flood in a nearby creek.</p>
            <p>Track Supervisor Ritchey said that he rode over this track on train 
              No. 5 a few hours prior to the accident and everything seemed satisfactory. 
              Supervisor of Bridges Hooper said that he rode engines over the 
              track in the vicinity of the point of derailment three times the 
              week previous traveling at a speed of at least 45 or 50 miles an 
              hour, and notices no uneven condition of the track or bridges.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusions.</strong></p>
            <p>This accident was caused by a weakened condition of the track due 
              to insufficient ballast.</p>
            <p>The evidence indicated that Section Foreman Blankenship had been 
              raising the track and putting in new ties, in doing which it had 
              been necessary to remove much of the old ballast. After this work 
              had been completed, there was not a sufficient amount of ballast 
              in the track, and the combination of thin ballast, new creosoted 
              ties, which are very slippery when wet, and heavy rain, undoubtedly 
              caused the track to slide out of line under the weight of the two 
              engines at high speed, resulting in such a violent notion of the 
              engines as to cause the left rail to overturn and derail the train.</p>
            <p>While the responsibility rests primarily with Section Foreman Blankenship, 
              the condition of the track in this vicinity was or should have been 
              known to supervising officials in the track department, and they 
              are open to censure for their failure to see that proper steps were 
              taken to make the track safe for the movement of heavy trains at 
              high speed, or else that proper warning signals were displayed and 
              restrictions imposed requiring trains to proceed at low speed until 
              they had passed over the section of insecure track.</p>
            <p>The maximum estimate made as to the speed of train second No. 94 
              was 45 miles an hour; if the air brakes were applied in emergency 
              as soon as the evidence indicates was the case, then it is believed 
              that this estimate undoubtedly represents the minimum rate at which 
              the train was traveling.</p>
            <p>The employees involved were experience men; at the time of the 
              accident the crew of train second No. 94 had been on duty less than 
              3 hours, after periods off duty ranging from 21 to 46 hours.</p>
