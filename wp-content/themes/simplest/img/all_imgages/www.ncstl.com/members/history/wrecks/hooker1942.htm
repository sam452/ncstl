              REPORT OF THE COMMISSION 1<br>
              PATTERSON, Commissioner:</p>
            <p>On March 1, 1942, there were derailments of a freight train and
              a passenger train on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis
              Railway at Hooker, Ga., which resulted in the death of two employees
              and the injury of one employee.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Diagram<br>
              Inv-2574 N., C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Hooker, Ga. March 1, 1942<br>
            Location of Accident and Method of Operation</p>
            <p>              These accident occurred on that part of the Chattanooga Division
              which extends between Nashville and Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance
              of 151.71 miles. In the vicinity of the points of the accidents
              this is a double-track line over which trains are operated by timetable,
              train orders and an automatic block-signal system. At Hooker the
              northward siding parallels the northward main track on the east
              and the southward siding is 4,007 feet in length. The north siding-switch
              of the southward siding is 673 feet north of the station. The first
              and second accidents occurred on the southward main track station
              at Hooker. As the points of the accidents are approached from the
              north there are, in succession, a 6 degrees 07 curve to the right
              1,152 feet in length, a spiral to the left 253 feet, a 6 degrees
              38 curve to the left 409 feet and a spiral to the left 254 feet.
              The derailments occurred on the latter-mentioned spiral at points
              171.5 feet end 60.5 feet from its southern end. Throughout a considerable
              distance south of the points of the derailments there are numerous
              short curves and tangents. The grade for south-bound trains varies
              between 0.92 percent and 1.21 percent descending throughout a distance
              of 2,291 feet to the points of the accidents, and is 1.21 percent
            at the points of the accidents.</p>
            <p>              On the curve involved the track structure consists of 110-pound
              rail, some of which were rolled in 1928 and the remainder in 1934,
              39 feet in length, laid on 21 or 22 treated hardwood ties to the
              rail length; it is fully tieplated, single-spiked, and is provided
              with 6 to 8 rail anchors per rail length. AT the points of the

              superelevation on the curve involved was 5-3/8 inches. At the point

            <p><strong>              Description of Accident</strong></p>
            <p> First 57, a south-bound third-class freight train, consisted
              of engine 659, 36 loaded cars and a caboose. At Stevenson, Ala.,
              28.47
                miles north of Hooker, the crew received copies of train order
              No. 561, Form 19, which read as follows:</p>
            <p>              No. 95 Eng 567 run thirty five 35 mins late Stevenson to NY Tower</p>
            <p>              This train departed from Stevenson at 1:23 p.m., according to
                    the dispatchers record of movement of trains, 8 hours 48
                  minutes late,
                    passed Whiteside, 4.03 miles north of Hooker and the last
                  station where time is shown, at 2:02 p.m., 8 hours 33 minutes
                  late.
                  While this train was moving at an estimated speed of 35 to
                  45 miles
                    per hour the front truck of the fourteenth car was derailed
                  to the
                    left at a point 2,418 feet north of the station at Hooker.
                  The train stopped about 2:20 p.m. with its rear end standing
                  at a
                    point about 6,600 feet south of the point of derailment.
                  The conductor
                    immediately proceeded toward the rear to flag No. 95 and
                  to inform the crew of that train of track conditions, but before
                  he reached
                  the point of derailment No. 95 became derailed.</p>
            <p>              No. 95, a south-bound first-class passenger train, consisted
                      of engine 567, of the 4-8-4 type, one express car, one
                  storage-mail car, one mail car, two express cars, one baggage
                  car, three
                      coaches, one Pullman sleeping cars, in the order named.
                  All cars were
                      of
                      steel construction. A terminal air-brake test was made
                  at Nashville, 141.55 miles north of Hooker, and the brakes
                  functioned
                      properly
                      en route. This train departed from Nashville at 10:44 a.m.,
                      according to the dispatchers record of movement of trains,
                      14 minutes late.
                      At Sherwood, Tenn., 45.14 miles north of Hooker, the crew
                      received copies of train order No. 561. Form 19, previously
                      quoted.
                      This train departed from Sherwood at 1:28 p.m., 40 minutes
                      late, passed
                      Bridgeport, Ala., 18.89 miles north of Hooker and the last
                      open office, at 1:58 p.m., 41 minutes late, and while moving
                      at a
                      estimated speed of 30 miles per hour it was derailed at
                  a point 2,307 feet
                    north of the station at Hooker.</p>
            <p>              Because of track curvature in the immediate vicinity of
                        the points where these accidents occurred, the view of
                        the track
                        ahead from
                        the cab of a south-bound engine is restricted to about
                      200 feet.</p>
            <p>              Engine 567 and its tender, remaining coupled, were derailed
                          to the left, continued forward 449 feet and stopped
                  on their left
                          sides with the front end of the engine on the southward
                          main track and the rear end on the northward siding.
                          The engine
                          truck was
                          broken and the cab was damaged. The first car was derailed
                          to the right end stopped 325 feet beyond, with its
                  front end on
                          the roadbed
                          and its rear end down the embankment. The second car
                          was derailed to the right and stopped 250 feet beyond,
                          upright,
                          with its
                          front end down the embankment and its rear end on the
                          southward main
                          track. The third car was derailed to the left and stopped
                          upright, considerably damaged, across both main tracks
                          and the northward
                          siding. The fourth, fifth and sixth cars were derailed
                          but remained upright and in line with the southward
                  main track.</p>
            <p>              It was clear at the time of these accidents, which
                            occurred about 2:18 and 2:25 p.m.<br>
              The employees killed were the engineer and the fireman
                            of No. 95, and the employee injured was the flagman
                            of First
                            57, who
                            was on
                          the engine of No. 95.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Mechanical Data</strong></p>
            <p>              After the accident an inspection of engine 567, of No. 95, disclosed
                that all flanges except the left No. 1 trailer-wheel tire were
                of good centaur and the heights were within the prescribed limits.
                All driving-box wedges were well lubricated and moved *** The
                  back-to-back measurements of engine-truck wheels, and the driving-wheel
                  and
                trailing-wheel tires and the lateral action of these wheels conformed
                to the prescribed requirements. The splash plates of the tender
                were in place. The automatic brake vale was in emergency position,
                the independent brake valve in running position, the reverse
                  lever in position for forward motion at short cut-off end the
                  throttle
              was half open.</p>
            <p>              The total weight of engine 567 in working order is 381,000 pounds,
                distributed at follows: Engine truck, 65,500 pounds; driving
                  wheels, 220,000 pounds; and trailer truck, 95,500 pounds. The
                  diameters
                of the engine-track wheels and the driving wheels are, respectively,
                33 inches and 70 inches, and of the trailer-truth wheels, 36
                  inches and 43 inches. The tender is of the Vanderbilt type
                  and is equipped
                with the four-wheel trucks. The weight of the tender loaded is
                194,000 pounds. The rigid wheelbase of the engine is 18 feet
                  3 inches, and the total length of the wheelbase is 44 feet
                  3 inches.
                The total length of the engine and tender is 93 feet 8 inches.<br>
              Inspection of engine 659, of First 57, disclosed no condition
                which might have contributed to the misalinement of the track.</p>
            <p>              The car which was derailed in the train of First 57 was a C. B. &amp; Q.
              R. R. steel box car. The front truck is of the Bettendorf type,
              equipped with lateral bolsters, roller side-bearings spaced 52
              inches apart, and spring planks upon which are mounted coil springs
              in cluster. The front wheels of the front truck are 33-inch, single-plate,
              cast iron, and were manufactured by the Griffin Wheel Company on
              December 13, 1940, for the Northern Pacific Railway. Inspection
              of this car disclosed that the side-bearing clearance at each side
              of both trucks was 1/8 inch, the wheel flanges were of full contour,
              and there was no indication or center binding or fouling of the
              truck. The foundation brake gear was in place and secure. There
              was no indication that the brake had been applied for excessive
              periods. After the accident the front wheels of the front truck
              were found to be derailed; however, there were indications that
              all four wheels had been derailed but the rear pair of wheels was
              rerailed before First 57 stopped. The right front wheel of the
              front truck was moved inward on its seat 5/8 inch. This wheel was
              cracked from the hub outward through the tread. There was no mark
              to indicate that the wheel had revolved on the wheel seat. The
              wheel bore numerous marks indicating that it had struck portions
              of the track structure with considerable force. The right back
            wheel of the front truck bore marks of having slid on the rail.</p>

            <p><strong>              Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>              First 57 passed the top of the grade about 1-1/2 miles north
                  of Hooker about 2:02 p.m. According to the order held by the
                  crew
                of First 57, No. 95 was due to leave Whiteside, 4 miles north
                  of Hooker and the last place to the rear where time was shown,
                  at
                2:13 p.m., and Hooker at 2:19 p.m. The speed of First 57 was
                  about 10 miles per hour and the conduct or instructed the flagman
                  to
                flag No. 95, end to inform the engineer of that train that First
                57 would either enter the siding at Hooker or proceed ahead of
                No. 95 to N. Y. Tower, 7.56 miles south of Hooker. After the
                  flagman alighted, the conductor signaled that flag protection
                  was being
                provided. The engineer partially closed the throttle and permitted
                the train to drift. According to the statement of the engineer,
                while his train was moving on the curve involved, where the maximum
                authorized speed was 30 m. p. h., the speed was about 35 miles
                per hour, the engine was riding smoothly, and the front brakeman,
                the fireman and he were maintaining a lookout ahead. Brake-pipe
                pressure of 90 pounds was being maintained. No brake application
                was made throughout a distance of about 1-1/2 miles on the descending
                grade, which averaged about 1 percent. When the engine reached
                a point about 180 feet north of the south end of the curve involved,
                the engine rolled laterally several times. The engineer made
                  a brake-pipe reduction of about 8 pounds and, at a point about
                  1,100
                feet farther south, as the engine and train appeared to be proceeding
                smoothly, he released the brakes. He looked back along his train
                several times but observed no indication of derailed equipment.
                Soon afterward the brakes were applied from the rear and the
                  train stopped. Later it was found that the front pair of wheels
                  of the
                front truck of the fourteenth car was derailed. Recording to
                  statements of the front brakeman and the fireman, the engine
                  rolled considerably
                on the curve involved but not more than engines had rolled in
                  this territory on previous occasion. According to the statement
                  of the
                conductor, the speed of his train on the curve was 35 to 45 miles
                per hour and he was on the left side of the caboose maintaining
                a lockout ahead. He felt the train brakes apply and then release.
                He observed one of the rear cars rocking dangerously and when
                  the caboose reached that point he thought it would overturn.
                  He immediately
                opened the conductors emergency valve and, when the speed was
                  reduced sufficiently he went back to warn the crew of No. 95
                  concerning
                the dangerous condition of the track. It was 2:20 p.m. when he
                started toward the rear. Before he could reach the point where
              the track was out of normal alinement, No. 95 was derailed.</p>
            <p>              The crew of a south-bound freight train which was the last train
                prior to First 57 and which passed over the track involved about
                10:30 a.m. said the speed of their train was about 25 miles per
                hour and they observed no indication of irregularity of the track
                in question; however, the engine of First 57 rolled and thrust
                severely, apparently as a result of some irregularity which existed
              prior to the passage of the engine of First 57.</p>
            <p>              According to the statement of the flagman of First 57, who was
                on the engine of No. 95 as that train was approaching the point
                where the accident occurred, the speed was about 40 miles per
                  hour, the engineman were maintaining a lockout ahead and the
                  throttle
                was about half open. The fireman informed the engineer that a
                  signal, located 117 feet north of the point of accident, was
                  displaying
                caution and the engineer made a service brake-pipe reduction.
                  Immediately afterward the engine started to swing, and this
                  action increased
                progressively until the engine was derailed. According to the
                  statement of the train porter, he was maintaining is lookout
                  ahead from the
                vestibule of the ninth car and observed the derailment of the
                  engine. The train brakes were applied in service prior to the
                  derailment,
                and were applied in emergency at the time the engine was derailed.
                Since both enginemen were killed in the accident it could not
                  be determined if either one observed the track condition prior
                  to
                the time the engine started to swing. Examination disclosed no
                condition of the engine of No. 95 existing prior to the accident
                which could have contributed to its cause. There was no indication
              of dragging equipment.</p>
            <p>              The front truck of the fourteenth car of First 57 became derailed
                to the inside of the leaving spiral of a 6 degrees 38 curve to
                the left when the train was moving at an estimated speed of 35
                to 45 miles per hour at a point where the superelevation was
                  4-1/8 inches. The maximum authorized speed on this curve was
                  30 miles
                per hour. The first marks of this derailment were on the inside
                ends of the first, second and fourth angle-bar bolts on the high
                rail at a joint 177 feet 8 inches north of the leaving end of
                  the spiral. Flange marks appeared on the top of a tie 8 inches
                  inside
                the gage side of the high rail at a point 6 feet 2 inches farther
                south. At a point 1 foot 11 inches farther south, a flange murk
                appeared on the top of a tieplate 6 inches outside the gage side
                of the low rail. There was no mark on the head of the low rail.
                Throughout a distance of 4,753 feet, flange marks appeared intermittently
                on the tops of the ties at a average distance of 9 inches inside
                the west rail end 7 inches outside the gage side of the east
                  rail. These marks indicated that a 4-wheel track was derailed,
                  and that
                the rear wheels became rerailed at the frog of the south switch
                of the southward siding. Only the front wheels of this truck
                  were found derailed at a point 7,655 feet south of the point
                  of derailment.</p>
            <p>              The first abnormal mark made by the engine of No. 95 was an abrasion
                on the gage side of the low rail 7 feet south of the point where
                First 57 was derailed. The mark was quite heavy and extended
                  a feet southward. Beginning at a point 61 feet farther south
                  the
                gage side of the low rail bore shearing marks throughout a distance
                of 10 feet 6 inches. Beginning at a point 4 feet 1-1/2 inches
                  farther south the web of the low rail was marked a distance
                  of 1 foot 11
                inches. In this locality the inside spikes of the low rail had
                been pulled about half their length. At a point 19 feet 1 inch
                north of the point where No. 95 was derailed, the inside angle
                bar at a joint of the low rail was marked by wheels, the rail
                  was canted outward and the inside spikes were pulled about
                  half their
                length. Throughout a distance of 5 feet 2 inches south of this
                joint, the gage side of the low rail was scored and abraded.
                  At a point 8 feet 8 inches farther south, wheel marks appeared
                  on
                the inside base of the rail throughout a distance of 5 feet 3
                  inches southward and pieces were broken out of the base. At
                  the point
                of the second derailment the inside rail was broken. This was
                  newly broken and the metal was sound. Opposite the brake in
                  the low rail
                the inside angel bar and angle-bar bolts at a joint in the high
                rail were marked and there was a flange mark 8 inches inside
                  the gage side of the rail. From this point southward 435 feet
                  of the
                southward main track was demolished during the general derailment.
                Throughout a distance of 738 feet north of the point where No.
                95 was derailed the track was shifted to the west distance varying
                between 1/4 inch and 7-/34 inches, and the gage side of the low
                rail was abraded at intervals. The gage varied between 4 feet
                  8-3/8 inches and 4 feet 9-1/4 inches. There was considerable
                  irregularity
                in the surface of the curve north of the point where No. 95 was
                derailed. Between stations 329 feet end 309.5 feet north, the
                  variation was 5/8 inch; between stations 173 feet and 153.5
                  feet north, the
                variation was 1-1/8 inches; and between stations 134 feet and
                  114.5 feet north, the variation was 5.8 inch. The track was
                  shifted to
                the west at points north of the point of the second derailment,
                as follows: 309.5 feet, 1 inch; 270.5 feet, 3-7/8 inches; 192.5
                feet, 1-1/2 inches; 153.5 feet, 7-3/4 inches; 114.5 feet, 5-5/8
                inches; 36 feet, 4-3/4 inches; and point of derailment, 1/4 inch.
                According to the statement of the section foreman, the shifting
                of the track resulted in a series of short angles. These variations
                in surface and alinement would cause engines and cars to swing
                and to roll laterally. This action undoubtedly resulted in the
                fourteenth car of First 57 thrusting hard against the high rail,
                and about the instant the train brakes were applied the car rebounded
                toward the low rail and the front truck was snapped over the
                  rail without marking it. As a result of the wheels chopping
                  the ties
                near the outer spikes of the low rail, undoubtedly the seating
                of the tieplates on the rails was weakened. When the engine of
                No. 95 rolled and thrust laterally as a result of the irregular
                surface and alinement of the track, the weakened seating of the
                tieplates of the low rail permitted the low rail to cant outward
                and the right engine-truck wheels to drop inside the high rail.<br>
              According to the statements of the track supervisor and the section
                foreman in charge of the section involved, the work of reballasting
                and surfacing of the track in question and the realining of the
                track with the center stakes was completed February 13. During
                this work 151 ties were renewed. About 21 hours before those
                accident occurred the engineer of a south-bound freight train
                filed a message
                that track irregularity exited on the curve involved. The section
                foreman was informed of this condition and about 1 hour later
                he raised the high rail 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch at a point about
                370
                feet north of the point where the car of First 57 was derailed.
                The second foreman said that because of a soft condition under
                the cinder fill on which the accident occurred, it is necessary
                to surface and to sline the track at intervals averaging about
              10 days.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Cause</strong></p>
            <p>              It is found that the first accident was caused by irregularity
                in surface and alinement of track combined with excessive speed
                on curve, and the second accident was caused by irregularity
                  in surface and alinement of track combined with weakened track
                  structure
              as a result of first derailment.</p>
            <p> Dated at Washington, D. C., this twenty-fifth day of April, 1942.</p>
