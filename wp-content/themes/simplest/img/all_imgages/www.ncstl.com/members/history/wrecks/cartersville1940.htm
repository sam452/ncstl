            <p>September 21, 1940</p>
            <p> To the Commission:</p>
            <p> On July 20, 1940, there was a side collision between a Nashville,
              Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway yard engine and a Louisville &amp; Nashville
              Railroad freight train, on the line of the first-mentioned carrier,
              at Cartersville, Ga., which resulted in the death of two employees
            and the injury of five employees.</p>
            <p> <strong>Location and Method of Operation</strong></p>
            <p>              Trains of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, hereinafter
              referred to as the L. &amp; N., are operated over the Nashville,
              Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway, hereinafter referred to as
              the N. C. &amp; St. L., between Atlanta and Junta, Ga., a distance
              of 47.81 miles. Junta is located 0.52 mile north of Cartersville.
              This accident occurred on that part of the Atlanta Division which
              extends between Atlanta, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance
              of 136.55 miles. In the vicinity of the point of accident this
              is a single-track line over which trains are operated by timetable,
              train orders and an automatic block system. The accident occurred
              within yard limits at a point 115 feet south of an industry-track
            switch, which is located 0.84 mile south of the station at Cartersville.</p>
            <p>              As the point of accident is approached. from the south there are,
              in succession, a tangent 5,465 feet long, a compound curve to the
              right 1,781 feet long, the maximum curvature of which is 4 degrees
              35, and a tangent 126 feet long; the accident occurred on this
              curve at a point 112 feet from its northern end. The grade for
              north-bound trains is, successively 0.20 percent descending a distance
              of 1,400 feet, 0.60 percent descending a distance of 1,600 feet,
              0.48 percent descending a distance of 1,400 feet, and practically
            level a distance of 2,300 feet to the point of accident.</p>
            <p>              A yard-limit sign is located 6,184 feet south of the point of accident.
              The industry track involved, known as Brooks Mill track, is more
              than 1,500 feet in length, extends south ward, and lies west of
              the main track. Entry to this track is made through a trailing-point
              switch for northward movements, which is provided with a No. 10
              turnout. The switch-stand is located on the west side of the main
              track. A derail, which operates in conjunction with the switch,
              is located on the industry track at a point 210 feet south of the
              switch. There is a telephone booth on the east side of the main
              track about 15 feet east of the switch-stand and a switch indicator
              immediately south of the telephone booth. Automatic. Automatic
              signal 46-4, which governs northward movements on the main line,
              is a 3-indication, color light signal, and is located 1,560 feet

              The following rules of the operating department read in whole or
            in part as follows:</p>
            <p>              93. Certain yards will be indicated by yard or station limit signs.
              Within such limits the main track may be used, protecting against
              first and second class trains. Third class and extra trains must
              move on the main track under such control that they can stop within
            the range of their vision.</p>
            <p>              505 (a). Block signals govern the use of the blocks, but, unless
              otherwise provided, do not supersede the superiority of trains;
              nor dispense with the use or the observance of other signals whenever
            and wherever they may be required.</p>
            <p>              505 (b). Block signals, unless otherwise provided, do not in any
              way supersede the rules governing the Operating Department, and
              do not relieve train men and others from any responsibility under
              such rules. The block signals are an extra precaution and must
            be so regarded and strictly observed.</p>
            <p>              512 (c). A switch must not be opened to permit a train movement
              to the main track, nor must a train come within fouling distance
              of the main track, unless such train is authorized by rule, time-table
              or train order to occupy main track or is protected as required
            by Rule 99.</p>
            <p>              515. A train occupying a siding where a switch indicator is used,
              must not, unless otherwise provided, enter the main track until
              a yellow light is displayed indicating that the block is clear
              in the direction in which the movement is to be made.<br>
              Where switch indicators are used, the indications displayed do
              not relieve enginemen and trainmen from protecting their train
            as required by the rules.</p>
            <p>              A time-table special instruction reads in part as follows:<br>
              17. Trains and engines using main track within yard or station
              limits as authorized by Rule 93, will, in addition protecting as
              required against first and second class trains, protect against
              other trains and engines if such other trains and engines have
              not a view of train or engine thus using main track of four hundred
            (400) feet or more, * * *.</p>
            <p>              Because of buildings, bill boards and an embankment near the track,
              and track curvature, the view to be had from the cab of a north-bound
              engine of cars or an engine standing immediately south of the derail
              on the industry track is restricted to a distance of 1,104 feet,
              and to 527 feet where it could be seen that the main track was
            fouled.</p>
            <p>              The maximum authorized speed for freight trains is 40 miles per
            hour.</p>
            <p>              The weather was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred
            about 3:25 p.m.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Description</strong></p>
            <p>              N. C. &amp; St. L. yard engine 423, with Engine Foreman S. B. Gilstrap
              and Engineman L. L. Gilstrap in charge, made a back-up movement
              pulling three cars from the south end of Brooks Mill track and
              stopped just south of the derail on that track. The engine foreman
              went to the telephone booth, and while he was conversing with the
              operator at Junta a switchman opened the main-line switch. Then
              the yard engine was started toward the main line and, while it
              was moving at a speed estimated at 3 to 7 miles per hour, the east
              side of the first car was struck by Extra 1517 North.<br>
              Extra 1517, a north-bound L. &amp; N. freight train, with Conductor
              Perkinson and Engineman Greenwell in charge, consisted of engine
              1517, 31 loaded and 12 empty cars and a caboose. This train departed
              from Atlanta, 47.29 miles south of Cartersville, at 1:40 p.m.,
              according to the train sheet, passed Acworth, 13 miles south of
              Cartersville and the last open office, at 3:07 p.m., passed the
              yard-limit sign at Cartersville, passed signal 46-4, which was
              displaying a proceed indication, and, while moving at a speed variously
              estimated at 25 to 50 miles per hour, struck the first car being
            pulled by yard engine 423.</p>
            <p>              Engine 423 and the first two cars were derailed. The engine, together
              with its tender, stopped bottom up, parallel to the industry track
              and west of it; the rear end of the tender stopped about 25 feet
              south of the switch. The first two cars were practically demolished,
              but the third car was neither derailed, nor damaged.<br>
              Engine 1517 and the first 15 cars were derailed. This engine stopped
              on its right side, parallel to the main track and east of it; the
              front end stopped against an earth mound, and the cab opposite
              the switch-stand; the tender was at right angles to the engine
              and across the track at the switch. The first 13 cars were derailed,
              demolished and destroyed by fire; the fourteenth and fifteenth
              cars were derailed and badly damaged. The derailed equipment was
            bunched within a distance of 200 feet.</p>
            <p>              Both engines were badly damaged; their pilot end-sills overlapped
              a distance of 36 inches, and the pilot end-sill, cylinder, steam-chest,
            and cross-head on the left side of each engine were broken.</p>
            <p>              The employees killed were the enginemen of both engines; the employees
              injured were the fireman and the front brakeman of Extra 1517,
            and the fireman and both switchmen of yard engine 423.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Summary of Evidence</strong></p>
            <p>              Engine Foreman Gilstrap, of yard engine 423, stated that his engine,
              pulling three freight cars, was backing northward on Brooks Mill
              track and soon after 3:20 p.m. it stopped about 3 or 4 feet south
              of the derail. He walked to the telephone booth and Switchman Keys
              followed closely, but the switchman remained out side the booth.
              As customary, the engine foreman telephoned the operator at Junta
              for information about trains. He was informed that one north-bound
              extra train had passed Acworth at 3:07 and another at 3:16 p.m.,
              and that the first train should be in the vicinity of Cartersville.
              The engine no foreman replied, &quot;All right, I will stay in
              here and let both of them by.&quot; While completing this sentence
              he heard the switch lever click and before finishing his conversation
              with the operator he heard the yard engine moving and Extra 1517
              approaching. He immediately ran out of the booth, waved stop signals
              with his hat and called a warning to the switchman, but it was
              then too late to avert the accident. He did not see anyone on the
              firemans side of the yard engine. He estimated the speed of the
              yard engine to be 3 or 4 miles per hour and that of Extra 1517
              to be 50 miles per hour when the accident occurred. Ordinarily
              the switchman who accompanies him to the telephone booth waits
              outside and remains away from the switch-stand until the engine
              foreman has given authority to open the switch and the switch indicator
              has been observed to determine the condition of the block. He said
              that Switchman Keys had worked as a member of his crew on previous
              occasions, but during the present assignment he had been working
              only 6 days. On the day prior to the accident the engine foreman
              had cautioned the switchman about the importance of operating switches,
              but nothing was said about it on the day of the accident. In this
              instance Switchman Keys opened the switch without permission or
              authority, without having pressed the button of the switch indicator,
              and before the engine foreman had finished the telephone conversation
              with the operator. Subsequently, at the hospital, the switchman
              told the engine foreman that he did not know why he opened the
              switch, and that after he opened it the yard engine backed a foul
              the main track before he could do anything to prevent the accident.
              The engine foreman could not understand how the switchman could
              have been mistaken the words &quot;all right&quot; spoken to the
              operator as having been intended as authority to open the switch.
              He stated that there was no rule requiring the engine foreman to
              obtain information over the telephone about trains before the yard
              engine entered upon the main track at this point, but that the
              trainmaster had orally instructed him to take such action; he did
              it as an added precaution and also to expedite train movements.
              Within yard limits a yard engine is permitted to use the main track
              without protecting against extra trains if a view of 400 feet or
              more is available. Extra trains are required to move under control
              within yard limits; however, such trains usually move through the
              yard limits involved at a speed of about 50 miles per hour. Automatic
              signals do not supersede the operating rules. He said that if the
              switch indicator had been used the accident could have been prevented.
              The brake pipe was coupled throughout the engine and the cars,
              and all brakes were operative. The yard engineman appeared normal
            during the course of switching operations.</p>
            <p>              Switchman Keys, of yard engine 423, stated that while the engine
              foreman was talking to the operator he stood in the middle of the
              main track and about 10 or 12 feet from the telephone booth. The
              switchman understood the engine foreman to say, &quot;All right,
              come out.&quot; He assumed that these words were addressed to him,
              so he went over to the switch-stand and unlocked and opened the
              switch. Then the engine foreman ran outs of the booth and shouted
              a warning of danger. At this time, however, the tender of the yard
              engine had backed north of the derail. The switchman remained at
              the switch-stand and waved stop signals on the engineman s side
              of the yard engine. At first he did not see anyone on that side
              of the engine but soon the yard engineman looked out just as his
              engine was fouling the main track, and then the accident occurred;
              he estimated the speed of Extra 1517 at 50 miles per hour. The
              switchman said that he did not receive any signal from the engine
              foreman, but, from what was said when the engine foreman was in
              the telephone booth, he felt certain it was intended that he should
              open the switch. After he opened the switch there was not sufficient
              time for him to give the yard engineman a signal before the yard
              engine began to back toward the main track. Subsequently, at the
              hospital, the engine foreman asked him why he had opened the switch,
              and the switchman replied that he understood the engine foreman
              to say, &quot;All right, come out. However, the engine foreman
              informed him at this time that these words were not intended for
              his guidance. The switchman said that during his present 6-day
              assignment with this yard crew the work had been performed in a
              similar manner every day on Brooks Mill track. He always accompanied
              the engine foreman to the telephone booth, and when it was permissible
              to use the main line the engine foreman, either when inside or
              outside the booth, would say in substance, &quot;All right, come
              out.&quot; Furthermore, the yard engineman had previously made
              the back-up movement on the indication of the switch target, apparently
              the same as was dome in this instance, without waiting for a hand
              signal to back. The switchman did not operate the switch indicator,
              as he thought the engine foreman would perform this duty; had he
              known that the engine foreman did not operate it, he would have
              done so. Automatic signal aspects in yard-limit territory do not
              supersede the yard-limit rule; however, all freight trains usually
              move through Cartersville yard on green aspects at a speed between
              40 and 50 miles per hour. In his opinion had either Extra 1517
              been moving under proper control within yard limits, or the switch
              indicator been operated by some member of the crew of yard engine
              423, the accident could have been prevented. Switchman Keys entered
              the service of this railroad on December 9, 1924. He said that
              he completed an oral and a written examination on the operating
              rules and the rules governing block signals given by the train-rules
              examiner on December 13, 1924 he had not been re-examined since
              that time. He worked intermittently from 1926 to 1929; his services
              were terminated in 1935 because of a reduction in personnel and,
            he returned to duty as an extra trainman on November 1, 1939.</p>
            <p>              Fireman Mathis, of yard engine 423, stated that when his engine
              stopped on Brooks Mill track at a point just south of the derail
              he was sitting on his seat-box. The engine foreman and the switchman
              went to the telephone booth. Soon thereafter the engineman released
              the engine brake and the fireman looked toward the switch. The
              switchman was at the switch-stand and the switch was open. He did
              not see the switchman give a signal to the engineman. While the
              engine foreman was still in the telephone booth the engineman said
              that the yard engine was being permitted to enter the main track
              and started the back-up movement. The fireman got down on the deck
              and was putting in a fire when the accident occurred. He estimated
              the speed of his engine at 3 or 4 miles per hour at the time of
              the accident, which occurred at 3:25 p.m. He did not see Extra
              1517 prior to the accident. During the time his engine stood on
              the industry track he looked across to the main track several times
              to determine if any north-bound train was approaching, hut saw
              none. Prior to starting the back-up movement the yard engineman
              appeared normal. At Brooks Mill track it is customary for the engine
              foreman to go to the telephone booth to obtain information about
              trains and for the switch indicator to be used. It was his observation
              that freight trains move at speeds of 40 to 50 miles per hour through
              Cartersville yard, which speeds are not in conformity with the
            yard-limit rule.</p>
            <p>              Switchman Hilburn, of yard engine 423, stated that it was 3:22
              or 3:23 p.m. when the yard engine stopped on the Brooks Mill track
              near the derail. When the back-up movement was started from that
              point he was on the ground on the east side of the industry track
              and about one car length south of his engine. The first knowledge
              he had of anything being wrong was when the engine foreman ran
              out of the telephone booths shouted, and gave stop signals. Then
              he saw the freight train approaching, and immediately thereafter
              the accident occurred. He estimated the speed of the freight train
              at 50 miles per hour, and that of the yard engine at 6 or 7 miles
              per hour when the accident occurred. He said that whenever he went
              to the telephone booth he was governed solely by the instructions
              of the engine foreman, and that the switchman always pressed the
              switch-indicator button before he opened the switch involved. It
              was his observation that freight trains were operated through Cartersville
              yard at a speed of about 50 miles per hour. He said that automatic
            block signals do not supersede operating rules.</p>
            <p>              Fireman Ross, of Extra 1517, scared that at Atlanta the air brakes
              were tested and they functioned properly en route. He was on the
              left seat-box, the front brakeman was behind him, and the engineman
              was on the right seat-box as their train approached Cartersville
              yard limits at a speed of about 40 miles per hour. The engineman
              made a brake-pipe reduction and the speed was reduced to 30 or
              35 miles per hour, and then a drifting throttle was used on the
              descending grade. The engineman sounded the whistle signal for
              a public crossing located north of the yard-limit board. Automatic
              signal 46-4 displayed a green aspect until the engine passed it.
              Around the outside of the curve involved the firemans view was
              obstructed and he was not aware of anything being wrong until the
              engineman applied the air brakes in emergency and called a warning
              of danger. The speed of the train at this time was 30 to 35 miles
              per hour. As the air brakes took effect the fireman saw a tank
              car on the Brooks Mill track, and then the accident occurred. Prior
              to the accident the engineman appeared normal. He said that automatic
              signal aspects within yard limits do not supersede yard-limit requirements;
              how ever, it was the practice of all enginemen, with whom he had
              worked, to operate freight trains through Cartersville yard at
              excessive speed. It was his opinion that if the yard-limit rule
              had been observed the accident could have been prevented.<br>
              Front Brakeman Swann, of Extra 1517, stated that when his train
              was about ten car lengths from the point of accident his engineman
              applied the brakes in emergency and shouted a warning to jump.
              The brakeman then looked out the left side of the engine cab and
            saw the yard engine about five car lengths distant.</p>
            <p>              Conductor Perkinson, of Extra 1517, stated that he was in the cupola
              as the train approached Cartersville yard limits at a speed of
              about 40 miles per hour. A brake-pipe reduction was made, the speed
              was reduced to 30 miles per hour when within yard limits, and then
              the brakes were released. He was not aware of anything being wrong
              until the air brakes were applied in emergency. The brakes were
              effective, the train moved about 400 to 450 feet, and the speed
              was about 25 miles per hour when the accident occurred. He said
              that from the caboose of a train such as the one involved it is
              impossible to determine whether the engineman is operating under
              such control that the train can be stopped within the range of
              vision. In this instance his train was operated in a manner similar
              to that in which it had been operated for years. In his opinion
            his train was not operated under proper control within yard limits.</p>
            <p>              Flagman Noe, of Extra 1517, stated that he was at the desk in the
              caboose when the accident occurred. His testimony as to what transpired
              was similar to that of other witnesses. The flag man thought that
              automatic signals which displayed green aspects within yard limits
            induced enginemen to disregard the requirements of Rule 93.</p>
            <p>              Operator Baldwin, at Junta, stated that as customary the engine
              foreman of yard engine 423 telephoned him for information about
              trains and he told the engine foreman about the two northbound
              extras that had passed Acworth. The operator advised him that it
              would be best for the yard engine to remain in the clear on Brooks
              Mill track until both of these extras passed, and then to follow
              them to Cartersville; the engine foreman replied., &quot;All right;&quot; the
              operator thought these were the last words used by the engine foreman
              to finish this conversation.<br>
              Trainmaster Swindell stated it was his observation that the point
              where the accident occurred was the only place in the Cartersville
              district where it was necessary to reduce speed considerably because
              of restricted view. There were other places within yard limits
              where enginemen reduced speed to some extent. While riding north-bound
              freight trains he had observed on a few occasions that enginemen
              failed to reduce speed sufficiently this point. He had frequently
              admonished enginemen to be careful at danger points, and yard crews
              to keep clear of third-class and extra trains, as a matter of extra
              precaution and expediting train movements. However, under Rule
              93 the yard engine involved could rightfully use the main track
              against the freight extra involved. On several occasions he had
              instructed the engine fore-man to call the operator at Junta when
              work of switching was completed on Brooks Mill track and obtain
              information on trains and also to operate the switch indicator
              before occupying the main track. Employees have been instructed
              that block signals are an additional safeguard and that block signal
              aspects must not be depended upon in disregard of Rule 93, which
              requires an engineman to operate under such control that his train
              can be stopped within the range of vision. However, it is apparent
              that at this location it has become the practice for enginemen
              to accept a green aspect displayed by automatic signal 46-4 as
              an indication that the main track is clear, and to operate their
              trains at excessive speeds within yard limits. The general performance
              of L. &amp; N. and N. C. &amp; St. L. crews operating over this
              track is similar. The yard limits at Cartersville extend about
              4 miles. He said that he makes frequent trips over the railroad
              on both passenger and freight trains, and that a traveling engineman
              and two traveling firemen are required to make such trips as their
              duties will permit. In his opinion L. &amp; N. Extra 1517 did not
            comply with the requirements of Rule 93.</p>
            <p>              Superintendent Hibbett stated that the reason he had not observed
                freight trains failing to comply strictly with the requirements
                of Rule 93 in the territory involved was that Brooks Mill track
                was in a remote section of Cartersville yard limits and he had
                not had occasion to visit that point. However, at other yard-limit
                locations he had observed freight trains complying with the requirements
                of Rule 93.<br>
              Signal Supervisor Riseden stated that after the damaged track
                circuits were repaired tests made of signal 46-4 and the switch
                indicator
                disclosed they functioned properly. When the switch indicator
                is operated it will indicate tether the block between Emerson,
                located
                4.58 miles south of Cartersville, and the switch is occupied
              by a north-bound train.</p>
            <p>              According to data submitted by the carrier, the total length
                of yard engine 423 is 61 feet 7 inches.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Observations of the Commissions Inspectors</strong></p>
            <p>              The Commissions inspectors observed tests made to determine
                      the extent of the view to be had from the cab of a north-bound
                      engine
                      on the main track of cars or an engine standing in the
                  clear on Brooks Mill track and it was found to be as previously
                  described. It was also observed that north-bound freight trains
                  entered
                      the
                    curve involved at speeds as high as 50 miles per hour.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Discussion</strong></p>
            <p>              According to the evidence, yard engine 423 was backing
                        at a speed estimated at 3 to 7 miles per hour on Brooks
                            Mill
                            track
                            toward
                            the main-track switch when, at a point 115 feet south
                    of the switch, the first of the three cars it was pulling
                            was struck
                            by the engine
                            of Extra 1517 North, which was moving at a speed.
                  Variously estimated to have been from 25 to 50 miles per hour.
                    Since the pilot end-sills
                            of the two engines overlapped about 36 inches it
                  is
                apparent that when the collision occurred the front end of the
                    yard engine was
                            near the frog and the rear end of the tender was
                  about 15 feet south of the switch point.</p>
            <p>              The accident occurred within yard limits at a point
                              approximately 4,700 feet north of the south yard-limit
                              board. An automatic
                              block system extended through the yard limits and
                              the last automatic signal passed by Extra 1517
                  was located
                              about
                              1,500 feet south
                              of the point where the accident occurred. All the
                              surviving employees involved understood that automatic
                              signal
                              indications in yard
                              limits
                              could be accepted by the crews of only first and
                              second-class trains; they understood that the yard
                              engine involved
                              could foul or occupy
                              the main track without protecting against trains
                              other than first and second-class trains unless
                  the crew
                              of an approaching
                              train
                              did not have a vision of the track ahead a distance
                              of 400 feet or more. As the weather was clear it
                              was possible
                              in
                              this case
                              for the engineman of Extra 1517 to see at a distance
                              or 527 feet that the main track was fouled. According
                              to the
                              evidence
                              the
                              engineman, who was the first to observe that the
                              main track was fouled, called
                              a warning at a point about ten car lengths distant
                              or approximately 425 feet, and applied the brakes
                              in emergency
                              but too late
                              to avert the accident.<br>
              The investigation disclosed that north-bound third-class
                              and extra trains have been operated through this
                              portion of the
                              yard limits
                              at Cartersville for a considerable period prior
                              to the time of the accident at speeds similar to
                              that
                              at which
                              Extra
                              1517 was
                              moving. As the engineman was killed in the accident
                              it is not known why he did not control the speed
                              of his
                              train in
                              compliance
                              with
                              the yard-limit rule; however, it appears that he
                              was operating according to past practice at this
                              point.
                              Subsequent to
                              this accident the Commissions inspectors observed
                              that third-class
                              and extra
                              trains moved through the yard limits involved at
                              speeds in excess of 50 miles per hour, notwithstanding
                              the
                              yard-limit rule and
                              the fact that the maximum authorized speed is 40
                              miles per
                              hour. It
                              is the duty of operating officials to enforce obedience
                              to operating rules, and failure for a considerable
                              length of
                              time of crews
                              to comply with the provisions of an operating rule
                              indicates that
                              operating officials have been negligent or lax
                          in enforcing obedience to the rule.</p>
            <p>              As an extra precaution and as a means of preventing
                                delays to main-line trains, the trainmaster had
                                instructed the
                                engine foreman
                                involved
                                to call on the telephone to obtain information
                                from the operator at Junta concerning the progress
                                of
                                trains en
                                route to Cartersville,
                                but there was no rule covering this matter. The
                                engine foreman was conversing with the operator
                                on the telephone
                                in regard
                                to the location of trains and from the information
                                received the
                                engine foreman said that his engine would remain
                                in the clear until after
                                two north-bound trains passed, but one of his
                  switchmen, understanding the engine foreman to indicate that
                                the yard engine would occupy
                                the main track immediately, lined the switch
                  for
                                entrance to the main track and the engineman,
                  without receiving
                                a signal,
                                started
                                his engine at once toward the switch. As the
                  yard engineman was killed in the accident it is not
                                known why he made
                                this movement
                                without signal; however, this switchman said
                  that on previous occasions the engineman had proceeded
                                on the
                                indication
                                of a switch target
                                only. The switch indicator located near the switch
                                involved was installed to enable the crew of
                  an engine, in the
                                clear on Brooks
                                Mill track and about to occupy the main track,
                                to ascertain if there was a train approaching
                  closely so that main-line
                                trains
                                would not be delayed by the engine. The rules
                  provided that outside of yard limits where switch indicators
                                were provided
                                the main
                                track could not be occupied unless the switch
                  indicator
                                showed that the
                                block was clear, but within yard limits the yard-limit
                                rule governed; this resulted in the switch indicator
                                involved being used for
                            information only.</p>
            <p>              If the switch involved had been opened before
                                  Extra 1517 passed the last signal preceding
                  the point
                                  of accident,
                                  that train
                                  would have received a stop indication at that
                                  signal; however, the
                                  fireman said that the signal displayed a green
                                  aspect, which statement
                                  is supported by the fact that Extra 1517 moving
                                  at a speed of 50 miles per hour would use 19.7
                                  seconds
                                  to
                                  traverse
                                  the distance
                                  of 1,445 feet from the signal to the point
                  of accident while the
                                  yard engine moving at an average speed of 7
                  miles per hour would use about 16 seconds in traversing
                                  the distance
                                  of
                                  about 165
                                  feet, the distance from the derail to the point
                                  the rear of the tender
                                  had reached when the accident occurred; therefore,
                                  it appears that the engine of Extra 1517 passed
                                  the signal
                                  3 or 4
                                  seconds before
                              the switch was opened.</p>
            <p>              <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
            <p> This accident was caused by failure to control the speed of Extra
              1517 properly while moving within yard limits.</p>
