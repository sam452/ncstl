            <p>IN RE INVESTIGATION OF AS ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, 
              CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST. LOUIS RAILWAY NEAR ESTILL SPRINGS, TENN. ON 
              AUGUST 1, 1919.</p>
            <p>September 16, 1919,</p>
            <p>On August 1, 1919, there was a rear-end collision between two freight 
              trains on the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway near 
              Estill Springs, Tenn., which resulted in the death of 1 employee 
              and the injury of 2 employees. After investigation of this accident, 
              the Chief of the Bureau of Safety reports as follows:</p>
            <p>The Chattanooga Division. on which this accident occurred, extends 
              from Nashville, Tenn., to Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance of 151 
              miles. Estill Springs is located 77 miles south of Nashville and 
              this railroad in the vicinity of Estill Springs is a single-track 
              line, over which train movements are governed by time-table and 
              train orders, no block signal system being in use. Approaching the 
              point of accident from the south the track is tangent for about 
              2,348 feet, followed by a 1-degree curve to the right 452 feet in 
              length, a tangent 1.341 feet in length and then a 2-degree curve 
              to the left 827 feet in length. The collision occurred on this last 
              mentioned curve, 65 feet north of its south and, and 913 feet north 
              of a bridge over Elk River. On the inside of the curve on which 
              the accident occurred an embankment rises about 10 feet above the 
              track and materially limits the view of enginemen on approaching 
              northbound trains. Approaching from the south the track is nearly 
              level to within 900 feet of the point of accident, followed by a 
              .97 per cent. ascending grade to the point of accident.</p>
            <p>On the day of the accident northbound freight train extra 402, 
              in charge of Engineman W. H. Blessing and Conductor Poe, left Cowan, 
              Tenn., at 8.10 a.m., to do switching work between Cowan and Tullahoma; 
              It arrived at Decherd, Tenn., at 8.20 a.m., and upon completion 
              of the switching at that point departed at 11.54 a.m., consisting 
              of locomotive 402, 16 cars and a caboose. Arriving at the south 
              end of the Estill Serings passing track at 12.05 p.m., the caboose 
              and 12 cars were left on the main track, while the locomotive and 
              4 cars were taken into the sand pit, about one-fourth mile distant, 
              for the purpose of making a switching movement. At this time the 
              conductor and flagman exchanged duties, the flagman going with the 
              head portion of the train to the sand pit, while the conductor remained 
              to protect the rear portion. At 12.35 p.m., the locomotive returned 
              with 5 cars and had just coupled to the other 12 cars, when northbound 
              freight train 1st No. 42 approached and collided with extra 402.</p>
            <p>Northbound freight train 1st No. 42 was a test train operating 
              for the purpose of determining the relative efficiency of hand and 
              stoker-fired locomotives, and was in charge of Engineman ODonnell 
              and Conductor Wiggs. This train, consisting of locomotive 653, 26 
              loaded cars, 4 empty cars and a caboose, left Chattanooga at 8.10 
              a.m., passed Decherd, the last train order office, at 12.27 p.m., 
              and at 12.35 p.m., while traveling at a speed estimated to have 
              been 10 or 12 miles an hour, collided with the rear end of extra 
              402 near Estill Springs.</p>
            <p>The locomotive of train 1st No. 42 came to rest with its pilot 
              and front end on the rear of the flat car of extra 402, with the 
              cupola of the *** caboose of extra 402 on top of the locomotive. 
              Four cars of extra 402, including the caboose, were overturned and 
              badly damaged. In train 1st No. 42, a wooden flat car was demolished 
              while an adjacent car was derailed and another overturned. As a 
              result of the collision Fireman Smith of train No. 42 was killed; 
              J. C. Blessing, local representative of the Brotherhood of Locomotive 
              Firemen and Enginemen who was riding on the locomotive of train 
              No. 42, was injured and H. M. Willis, mechanical draftsmen, who 
              was also riding on the locomotive of train No. 42 was slightly injured. 
              At the time of the accident a drizzling rain was falling.</p>
            <p>Engineman Blessing of extra 402 stated that upon arrival of his 
              train at Estill Serings, the locomotive and first four cars were 
              out off and he took this part of the train to the sand pit where 
              he left the four cars and picked up five others, returning then 
              to the rear portion of the train. While his train was being coupled 
              up, his fireman saw train No. 42 approaching from the south and 
              called out to him, &quot;Bill, I believe they are going to run into 
              us.&quot; When the engineman looked out and saw that a collision 
              was inevitable, he sounded the whistle to warn his brakeman who 
              was between cars coupling up the air hose. Engineman Blessing said 
              that he heard no torpedoes exploded nor any whistle sounded by train 
              No. 42. He also said that about a minute elapsed between the time 
              he first saw train No. 42 and the time of the collision and he was 
              unable to pull his train out of the way.</p>
            <p>Flagman Norvell of extra 402 stated that on leaving Decherd he 
              asked his conductor whether they would leave the train on the main 
              line at Estill Serings while performing their duties in the sand 
              pit or whether they would take the train on to the side track, at 
              the same time suggesting to the conductor that, in order to save 
              time, the train be left on the main track. He also made the suggestion 
              to the conductor that the conductor protect the rear end of the 
              train while he attended to the switching in the sand pit. He received 
              instructions from his conductor which were in conformity with his 
              suggestions and upon arrival at Estill Springs he went to the sand 
              bit with the locomotive and four cars. Within a half-hour they returned 
              to the main track with five cars and he was coupling them up with 
              the balance of the train when the collision occurred. Flagman Norvell 
              stated that he did not know how far Conductor Poe went back to protect 
              the train, but that if he had been doing the flagging he would have 
              remained at the south end of Elk River bridge until called in. He 
              stated that the conductor had not been called in when the collision 
              occurred.</p>
            <p>Conductor Poe of extra 402 stated that his train left Decherd at 
              11.55 a.m. and that he had no information concerning following trains 
              at that time. He stated that he had made arrangements with Flagman 
              Norvell to go to the sand pit at Estill Springs, thinking that the 
              flagman could handle the work there more efficiently than he could. 
              Then the train stopped at Estill Springs, he started back with torpedoes 
              and went back to mile post 78, about a half-mile distant, and there 
              placed two torpedoes on the rail. He then came back to the south 
              end of Elk River bridge from which point he could watch the locomotive 
              of his train at work in the sand pit an there placed one torpedo 
              on the rail. When he saw his locomotive starting back to the main 
              track with the 5 cars, he picked up the torpedo and started across 
              the bridge toward his train. He stated that the reason he started 
              in as soon as he did was so that he could get in promptly when called. 
              Just before the locomotive and five cars coupled to the standing 
              cars, he saw train No. 42 coming around the curve, at which time 
              he was about 20 car lengths from his caboose. He did not hear train 
              No. 42 explode the torpedoes which he had left at mile post 78. 
              He stated that he started flagging the approaching train as soon 
              as he saw it but the engineman did not answer his signals, although 
              he thought he had been seen, as when the train reached the south 
              end of the bridge, he saw dust and sand flying, indicating that 
              the brakes had been applied in emergency. When the locomotive of 
              train No. 42 passed him he yelled to the engine crew, but he received 
              no response. Conductor Poe stated further that he considers 20 car 
              lengths a sufficient distance to remain back to protect a train 
              if the train is protected by torpedoes farther back, and he said 
              he would not have remained back father to flag a passenger train. 
              he also stated that he knew of other instances when torpedoes had 
              failed to explode.</p>
            <p>Engineman ODonnell, of train No. 42, stated that the air brakes 
              on his train were tested before leaving Chattanooga on the day of 
              the accident and all were found to be working properly. After leaving 
              Cowan he came down the mountain grade slowly, making about 3 applications 
              of the brakes, and on each occasion the brakes worked properly. 
              At Decherd he received a clear board and proceeded toward Estill 
              Springs. At just about the time he reached the north end of the 
              Elk River bridge and while running at a speed of about 25 miles 
              an hour. J. C. Blessing, who was standing beside him, called out 
              to him, &quot;Look out, Jack,&quot; and at about the same time he 
              grabbed hold of the brake valve handle, opened the sand lever and 
              leaned out of the window. He saw the caboose of extra 402 only 14 
              or 15 car lengths ahead and saw a man 4 or 5 car lengths south of 
              the caboose, who he learned afterwards was Conductor Poe. He stated 
              further that he reduced the speed of his train from 25 miles an 
              hour at the time Mr. Blessing spoke to him to 10 or 12 miles an 
              hour at the time of the collision. Engineman ODonnell stated he 
              did not hear any torpedoes or see the smoke of extra 402 as he approached 
              Estill Springs, neither did he have any knowledge of extra 402 being 
              ahead of him. He stated that the time card authorizes extra trains 
              to run ahead of third class trains.</p>
            <p>Traveling Fireman Neal, who was riding on the locomotive of train 
              No. 42 and having charge of the fuel test being made, stated that 
              approaching Estill Springs he noticed smoke near the passing track 
              switch and remarked to Mr. Blessing who was sitting behind him that 
              if that train was on the main track, it looked near. As train No. 
              42 neared Estill Springs, he kept on looking ahead, but failed to 
              see anything of the caboose of extra 402 until the train had passed 
              over Elk River Bridge. At the time he saw the caboose he also saw 
              a man with a red flag; he immediately rushed to the right side of 
              the locomotive and reversed the engine, Engineman ODonnell applying 
              the brake in emergency and opening the sand lever at the same time. 
              He judged that the train was 14 or 15 car lengths from the caboose 
              when he first saw the flagman of extra 402 and that the flagman 
              *** car lengths from the caboose; he estimated the speed *** No. 
              42 at that time to be 20 or 25 miles an hour. He further stated 
              that he heard no torpedoes exclude.</p>
            <p>Trainmaster ***, who was riding on the caboose of train No. 42 
              and assisting with the test, stated that the engineman did not exceed 
              a speed of 30 miles an hour between Decherd and Estill Spring and 
              that the speed was about 25 miles an hour across Elk River bridge. 
              Just before the caboose reached the bridge he felt the brakes go 
              on in emergency and after the train had run a distance of not more 
              than 15 car lengths, he felt a second jar which was caused by striking 
              the caboose of extra 402. He did not hear torpedoes and could not 
              recall whether or not he heard a whistle signal of any kind approaching 
              Estill Springs.</p>
            <p>Conductor Wiggs, of train No. 42, stated that he heard no torpedoes 
              approaching Estill Springs. He felt the application of the brakes 
              in emergency 10 or 12 car lengths from the point of collision at 
              which time the speed was about 25 miles an hour. He thought the 
              speed had been reduced to about 15 miles an hour when the collision 
              occurred. The stated that he did not see Conductor Poe before the 
              accident occurred and does not know where he was located.</p>
            <p>Head Brakeman Moody, of train No. 42, stated that he had gone back 
              to the caboose to eat his lunch and was washing some dishes when 
              he felt the brakes applied in emergency. He stated that the train 
              traveled a distance of 7 or 8 car lengths after the brakes were 
              applied before the collision occurred. He estimated the speed of 
              the train at 25 or 30 miles an hour at the time the brakes were 
              applied.</p>
            <p>Rear Brakeman Terry, of train No. 42, stated that from the time 
              the brakes were applied to the time the collision occurred, the 
              train ran a distance of 6 or 7 car lengths. He further stated that 
              he went back to protect the rear of his train immediately after 
              the accident and saw no torpedoes on the track near mile post 78.</p>
            <p>Mechanical Draftsman Willis, who was siding on the locomotive of 
              train No. 42 in connection with the test, stated that his first 
              intimation of the impending accident was when he heard Mr. Blessing 
              give warning and the brakes were applied in emergency. He stated 
              he then swung out of the window, saw the corner of the caboose of 
              extra 402 just ahead, jumped off and was knocked unconscious. He 
              stated further that he did not see the conductor of extra 402 at 
              the time he swung out of the window.</p>
            <p>George Hendon, colored, who lives near Elk River bridge, stated 
              that on the day of the accident he came home for dinner at 12.15 
              p.m. and noticed a flagman standing near the north end of the bridge. 
              After he had gone inside his house to eat it started to rain. A 
              short time later he heard train No. 42 approaching and upon looking 
              out saw the flagman running from the caboose of the standing train 
              toward the approaching train, and he judged the flagman was 5 or 
              6 car lengths from the caboose at that time. It was his supposition 
              that the flagman he saw near the bridge at 12.15 p.m. went to the 
              caboose for shelter when it started to rain.</p>
            <p>Alvin Cook, employed at Heikens Gravel Pit; stated that he saw 
              train No. 42 approaching the point of accident and noticed a flagman 
              from extra 402 running toward the approaching train, being about 
              2 car lengths from the standing caboose when he first saw him.</p>
            <p>This accident was caused by the failure of Conductor Poe properly 
              to protect the rear of his train, in accordance with rule 99 of 
              the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad book of Operating 
              Rules, which reads in part as follows:</p>
            <p>When a train stops or is delayed, under circumstances in which 
              it may be struck, the flagman must go back immediately with stop 
              signals a sufficient distance to insure full protection, at which 
              point he must place two torpedoes on the rail, two rail lengths 
              apart, as a caution signal. He may then return to much distance 
              from his train as will admit of a stop signal being given to an 
              approaching train by hand or torpedo in time to prevent accident, 
              where he will place one torpedo on the rail. When recalled, he may 
              return to his train, first removing the single torpedo.</p>
            <p>While the statements of Conductor Poe and other witnesses conflict 
              in regard to his location on the arrival of train No. 42, Conductor 
              Poe himself admitted that he had not been called in by the engine 
              whistle when he started to return to his train, and that he was 
              no more than 20 car lengths from his caboose when he signalled the 
              following train to stop. According to his own statement, therefore, 
              he was not in position to furnish adequate protection for his train, 
              and the fact that he returned nearly to his train before being called 
              in indicated a wanton disregard for the elemental principles of 
              train protection. The weight of evidence is that he was considerably 
              less than 20 car lengths from the rear end of his train when No. 
              42 approached. Had a block signal system been in operation on this 
              line this accident might have been averted.</p>
            <p>Conductor Poe entered the service of the Nashville, Chattanooga 
              &amp; St. Louis Railroad as brakeman in July, 1892, and was promoted 
              to conductor in 1897. His service record shows no offense of any 
              great magnitude standing against him.</p>
            <p>None of the employees involved in this accident had been on duty 
              in violation of the provisions of the Hours of Service Law.</p>
