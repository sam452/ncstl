            <p> NC&amp;StL Nashville, TN 9 July 1918 incorrect train identification </p>
            <p>Nashville<br>
              The Nashville collision of 9 July 1918 on the Nashville, Chattanooga
                and St. Louis had the highest fatality toll of any United States
                railroad accident, somewhere between 90 and 100. Six wooden coaches
                were destroyed in the severe collision, which was the primary
                reason for the large number of fatalities. It is discussed at
                some length in Shaw, but there are other points to be made about
                this accident.</p>
            <p>Time table directions on the NC&amp;StL were northward and southward,
              with southward, odd-numbered trains superior to even-numbered trains
              of the same class in the opposite direction. The trains involved
              in this accident were proceeding to and from Memphis, via the junction
              with the L&amp;N at McKenzie, so they generally moved east and
              west by the compass. Leaving Nashville for Memphis, the line went
              southward for some distance, so northbound trains were actually
              running southward, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>Although the division was mainly single-track, operated by time
              table and train order, double track was provided between the passenger
              station at Nashville and Shops, 2.5 miles. At Shops there was an
              interlocking controlling the switch at the end of two main tracks,
              with the normal interlocking signals, and this was also an open
              train order office. It was a very common practice to provide short
              sections of double track at congested locations on a single-track
              line. As another concrete example, the CRI&amp;P had 4.1 miles
              of double track through Oklahoma City. There were No. 15 spring
              switches at each end, so that trains moving with the current of
              traffic did not have to stop to line switches. The speed limits
              through these switches was 30 mph Rockets, 25 mph passenger and
              20 mph freight. There were 5 gated crossings at which the speed
              limit was 20 mph, and first-class trains were required to run at
              restricted speed at a point where the view was obscure, so speeds
              were not high.</p>
            <p>Rule S-83 states that &quot;A train must not leave its initial
              station on any division or subdivision, or a junction, or pass
              from one of two or more tracks to single track, until it has been
              ascertained whether all trains due, which are superior, have arrived
              or left.&quot; Strictly, this means that there must be either a
              train register, or an open office where information can be obtained,
              or at least a telephone, at each end of double track. At Nashville,
              this was, in fact, the case. At Oklahoma City (and most other places)
              it was not (though there was a telephone at the west end of two
              main tracks). In fact, these short sections of double track were
              not operated like double track, but more like long sidings. Trains
              using them would have satisfied Rule S-83 at other points, and
              would be required to identify trains met on double track as if
              they were encountered on a siding. Normally on double track a train
              is not concerned with what passes on the other track, but on these
              sections things are different. Note that it is a very different
              case from a single-track section on a double-track line, which
              demands strict observance of Rule 83.</p>
            <p>Train No. 4 was scheduled to leave Nashville at 7.00 am for Memphis,
              while Train No. 1 was scheduled to arrive Nashville at 7.10 am.
              When No. 4 checked the register at Nashville, No. 1 was usually
              not yet registered. Since it was the superior train, No. 4 had
              to clear its time, which meant that No. 4 could not pass Shops
              until No. 1 had arrived and departed there. Normally, No. 1 was
              encountered on double track, and identified by the engine number.
              On reaching Shops, the switch would be lined to pass to single
              track, and the interlocking signal would display Proceed.</p>
            <p>On this day, No. 1, with a baggage car, 5 coaches and 2 sleepers
              was running about 30 minutes late, passing Bellevue, 12.6 miles
              from Nashville, at 7.09 am. No. 4 received the following order
              at Nashville: &quot;No 4 eng 282 hold main track meet No 7 eng
              215 at Harding No 1 has eng 281.&quot; The crew of No. 4 was very
              used to receiving an order like this, that gave them something
              on No. 7 as well as the engine number of No. 1, the dispatcher
              reminding them of the train in this way. This order was in no way
              novel or confusing, and there is no possibility that the &quot;7&quot; was
              mistakenly read as &quot;1,&quot; as is clear from the testimony
              of the survivors.</p>
            <p>No. 4 left 7 minutes late, at 7.07 am. The conductor busied himself
              with his favorite job, tickets, and left the running of the train
              up to others. A switch engine and a cut of cars rumbled by on the
              other track, which the flagman noted and recognized as a yard movment,
              not No. 1. The engineman was on the wrong side to observe, and
              probably the fireman was busy putting his fire in condition for
              the run ahead, when the yard movment passed them. The conductor
              and head brakeman noted that something passed, but they could not
              see it well, of course. At Shops, the switch was lined and the
              signal was clear, so No. 4 entered single track and accelerated.
              Everyone--except for the flagman--thought that the yard movement
              had been No. 1. We might ask what the yard movement was doing on
              No. 1's time, but that is another matter.</p>
            <p>The operator at Shops checked his train book, which showed that
              No. 1 had not arrived, and immediately blew the emergency air whistle,
              going outside and waving frantic washouts at the receding train,
              which paid no attention. The dispatcher was on the phone and aware
              of events. It is clear that the switch should have been lined for
              No. 1, and the signal for No. 4 at Stop, until No. 1 had arrived.
              We do not know if the operator lined the switch and cleared the
              signal on the approach of No. 4 without considering No. 1. It also
              would have been so easy for the dispatcher to have arranged that
              the operator would phone him before clearing the signal to enter
              single track. These are questions that cannot now be answered,
              and they were not asked in the ICC investigation.</p>
            <p>It is easy to say that the flagman, who was inexperienced, should
              have pulled the air when his train passed Shops. He would have
              assumed that the conductor would know best, and would definitely
              have been unpleasant to him had he stopped the train when they
              held an order against No. 1 handed up at Shops that simply had
              not been shown to him yet. No, the flagman can be exonerated, but
              the conductor cannot. The accident was due to his failure to positively
              identify No. 1, and his was the primary responsibilty, which he
              abdicated. After the accident, he said that he always conferred
              with the other crew members to make certain of the identification
              of No. 1, but this is a patent lie, since he did not consult the
              flagman. The engineman was also at fault, of course, for not asking
              for signals from the conductor as he approached Shops. The meeting-point
              whistle would have been quite appropriate in this case (it may
              not have been authorized by the NC&amp;StL, and was not mentioned
              in the ICC report). If answered by a highball, it would mean that
              No. 1 was by.</p>
            <p>The two trains met, each moving at about 50 mph, halfway between
              Shops and Harding, still within the city limits of Nashville, at
              7.20 am.</p>
            <p>The ICC investigation is shallow, and does not bring out many
              of the important points. The comments and recommendations of the
              ICC are also badly conceived, as, for example, that the engine
              number is bad identification. If for some reason, one does not
              see the engine number clearly, a stop at Shops would have been
              the answer. The big problems are the characteristic malfeasance
              of the conductor, and not insisting on positive identification.
              The possibility of the control of the signal on the dispatcher's
              OK, which could have been done without extra cost, was not mentioned.</p>
