              REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF SAFETY IN RE INVESTIGATION
              OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA &amp; ST.
              LOUIS RAILWAY AT WESTPORT, TENN., ON AUGUST 15, 1927.<br>
              <br>
              October 15, 1927.<br>
              <br>
              To the Commission:<br>
              <br>
              On August 15, 1927, there was a head-end collision between a Nashville,
              Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway passenger train and a Gulf,
              Mobile &amp; Northern Railroad freight train on the tracks of the
              first-named railway at Westport, Tenn., which resulted in the death
              of 1 employee and the injury of 82 passengers, 5 employees, 3 persons
              traveling on free transportation, and 1 person carried under contract.<br>
              <br>
              Location and method of operation<br>
              <br>
              This accident occurred on that part of the Paducah and Memphis
              Division extending between Bruceton and Memphis, Tenn., a distance
              of 143.2 miles; in the vicinity of the point of accident this is
              a single-track line over which trains are operated by time-table
              and train orders, no-block-signal system being in use. Freight
              trains of the Gulf, Mobile &amp; Northern Railroad are operated
              over the tracks of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway
              under a trackage agreement between Bruceton and Jackson, Tenn.,
              a distance of 58 miles. The accident occurred at a point 2,095
              feet south of Westport station; approaching this point from the
              north the track is tangent for a distance of 4,919 feet, the accident
              occurring on this tangent at a point 364 feet from its southern
              end. Approaching from the south there is 4,465 feet of tangent
              and a 1 degree 59 curve to the left 956 feet in length, followed
              by the tangent on which the accident occurred. The grade at the
              point of accident is 0.36 per cent ascending for southbound trains.
              There is a passing track paralleling the main track on the east,
              the south switch being located about 778 feet north of the point
              of accident.<br>
              <br>
              The weather was clear at the time of the accident, which occurred
              at about 5.07 p.m.<br>
              <br>
              Description<br>
              <br>
              Southbound third-class Gulf, Mobile &amp; Northern freight train
              No. 330 consisted of 16 cars and a caboose, hauled by G.M. &amp; N.
              engine 263, and was in charge of Conductor Milam and Engineman
              Wood. This train left Bruceton, 12.2 miles north of Westport, at
              4.33 p.m., according to the train sheet, one hour and eight minutes
              late, passed Westport at 5 p.m., without having received any train
              orders relative to train No. 103, and was brought to a stop by
              the conductor with the caboose approximately one car-length south
              of the south switch of the passing track at Westport. An attempt
              was then made to back into the passing track but before this could
              be accomplished the train was struck by train No. 103.<br>
              <br>
              Northbound passenger train No. 103 consisted of one combination
              mail and baggage car, one baggage car, three coaches, one Pullman
              parlor car and four coaches, in the order named, hauled by engine
              537, and was in charge of Conductor Vallandingham and Engineman
              Kane. This train departed from Yuma, 3.71 miles south of Westport,
              at 5.02. p.m., on time, and shortly afterwards it collided with
              southbound freight train No. 330 while traveling at a speed estimated
              to have been between 35 and 50 miles per hour.<br>
              <br>
              Engine 263 was derailed and came to rest on its right side in a
              badly damaged condition. The tender was also derailed together
              with the forward truck of the first car in train No. 330, while
              the forward truck car was partly telescoped. Engine 537 was practically
              demolished, the boiler being torn from its frame and hurled forward
              a distance of approximately 150 feet. The tender was badly damaged
              and came to rest on its right side, while the forward end of the
              first car was derailed to the right, the car coming to rest in
              an upright position diagonal with the track. The forward pair of
              wheels of the leading truck of the second car was also derailed;
              none of the other equipment in train No. 103 was derailed and it
              sustained only slight damage. The employee killed was the engineman
              of train No. 330.<br>
              <br>
              Summary of evidence<br>
              <br>
              Firemen Liddell, of train No. 330 stated that as his train approached
              the north passing-truck switch he observed the train-order signal
              in the clear position and the engineman called its indication.
              The speed was reduced to about 10 or 15 miles per hour, enough
              so that it could have been stopped before it passed the switch,
              but shortly afterwards the engineman began working steam. Both
              Fireman Liddell and the head brakeman informed the engineman that
              they would have to get into clear for train No. 103, to which the
              engineman replied that he intended to pull and by back in. Engineman
              Wood was looking at his time-table between the north switch and
              the station, and as the train was passing the station, at about
              5 p.m., traveling at a speed of about 20 miles per hour, the brakes
              were applied from the caboose, at which time he again informed
              the engineman that they would have to meet train No. 103; he did
              not, however see any one at the station giving signals. The engineman
              continued to work steam, and also placed the brake valve in the
              release position, and after the train had been brought to a stop
              just south of south switch the engineman kept moving the brake
              valve handle back and forth in an effort to release the brakes.
              Fireman Liddell saw the rear brakeman open the switch and then
              told the engineman to back up, but on account of difficulty in
              releasing the brakes the train could not be moved for about three
              minutes. In the meantime the engineman told the head brakeman to
              protect the train by flag and the head brakeman to protect the
              train by flag and the head brakeman left the cab on the enginemans
              side with a red flag; shortly after he had done so the fireman
              heard the engineman call him back but he did not hear the conversation
              which took place between them. Fireman Liddell made no attempt
              to afford protection as he thought the head brakeman then went
              forward for that purpose, saying that he could not see the brakeman
              due to the latters position on the opposite side of the engine.<br>
              <br>
              Head Brakeman Keeatoll, of train No. 330, stated that as the train
              was approaching the north switch the engineman sounded the station
              whistle signal, at which time the conductor gave a stop signal
              from the caboose which the engineman answered with one short blast
              of the whistle. Expecting the train would head in at the north
              switch, the head brakeman proceeded along the running board to
              the pilot of the engine for the purpose of opening the switch.
              The speed had been reduced top about 10 miles per hour but before
              the engine reached the switch the speed was increased, and on realizing
              they were going to pass the switch he gave the engineman a signal
              to head in, but at this time the engineman was looking at his time-table.
              Brakeman Keeton said he then went back into the cab and asked the
              engineman if they were not going to most train No. 103 at the point
              and at about this time the air brakes were applied from the caboose.
              Realizing they were getting close to the time of train No. 103
              he procured a red flag, already having four torpedoes in his possession,
              and as soon as the train came to a stop he got off the engine and
              started forward but the engineman called to him to look back and
              see what kind of signals were being given from the rear of the
              train; he informed the engineman that a back-up movement was to
              be made, this conversation detaining him a few seconds. Upon reaching
              a point a few feet in front of the engine the engineman again called
              his back, which request he failed to comply with, but instead he
              turned around and gave the engineman a backup signal. He then started
              forward but had only reached a point about 200 or 250 feet from
              his train when he observed train No. 103 approaching, about one
              telegraph-pole length from the southern end of the curve, and at
              once began waving his red flag. Brakeman Keeton further stated
              that it was impossible for him to have gone ahead a greater distance
              as his train had been stopped only one minute before the accident
              occurred, at about 5.05 p.m., although he said it was not as late
              as 5 p.m. when his train was approaching the north switch. He could
              give no reason why the engineman requested him to watch for signals
              instead of permitting him to protect his train promptly, as the
              train was on straight track and there was no reason why signals
              given from the rear end could not have been seen either by the
              engineman or by the fireman.<br>
              <br>
              Conductor Milam, of train No. 330, stated that he was riding in
              the caboose as his train approached Westport and when the engineman
              sounded the station whistle signal he gave the engineman a stop
              signal which was acknowledged. As the train neared the north switch
              steam was shut off and the brakes applied and he supposed the train
              would head in at that point, but shortly afterwards the brakes
              were released and the engine began working steam. He then supposed
              that the train-order signal was set against them and that they
              would receive an order involving train No. 103. His first knowledge
              that the signal was not set against them was when he went to the
              rear platform of the caboose for the purpose of catching the expected
              order and at this time he observed the signal in the clear position;
              the train then was traveling between 25 and 30 miles per hour and
              the caboose was between the north switch and the station. Thinking
              the engineman had overlooked train No. 103 he immediately re-entered
              the caboose and applied the air brakes by means of the conductors
              emergency valve, closing the valve just before the train came to
              a stop, at 5 p.m., with the caboose about one car-length south
              of the south switch. Shortly after it had stopped he observed the
              head brakeman get off the engine with a flag and start forward,
              and at about the same time he instructed the rear brakeman to open
              the switch and then go back to protect the train. The switch was
              then opened and a signal was given the engineman to back up, which
              signal was answered by three short blasts of the engine whistle.
              An attempt was made to back the train but on account of the fact
              that the brakes were sticking an interval of about three minutes
              elapsed before the train could be started. Conductor Milam said
              that during that tine he bled off the air from the two rear cars
              but that there were still some brakes which were sticking on the
              front end of the train, and that the train had been moved back
              only a short distance before it was struck by train No. 103; he
              immediately looked at his watch and it was then 5.05 p.m. Conductor
              Milam further stated that his train passed the north switch at
              about 4.59 p.m., which would have allowed ample time to get into
              clear at this point as train No. 103 is not scheduled to leave
              Westport until 5.08 p.m., and he was of the opinion that had the
              head brakeman gotten off and gone forward promptly there was time
              enough for him to have warned the crew of the opposing train in
              time to have avoided the accident. Conductor Milam also stated
              that he might have observed the train-order signal sooner than
              actually was the case, but as the engineman applied the brakes
              before reaching the north switch he was of the impression that
              it was the intention to head in at that point and paid no further
              attention to the matter until after the caboose had passed that
              point.<br>
              <br>
              The statements of Brakeman Nelson, of train No. 330, practically
              corroborated those of Conductor Milam, adding that he got off before
              the train came to a stop, opened the south switch, gave a signal
              to back up, and then proceeded to the rear for the purpose of protecting
              the movement, reaching a point about three car-lengths south of
              the station before the occurrence of the accident; at this time
              the operator was inside the station.<br>
              <br>
              Engineman Kane, of train No. 103, stated that his first knowledge
              of anything wrong was when the fireman, who had just completed
              putting in a fire, looked out on the inside of the curve and shouted
              a warning of danger. The speed of his train then was about 45 or
              50 miles per hour and he immediately applied the air brakes in
              emergency and opened the sanders, but he did not think there was
              time enough for the speed to be reduced to any great extent. He
              estimated the time of the accident at about 5.07 p.m.<br>
              <br>
              Fireman Wilkins, of train No. 103, stated that he first observed
              train No. 330 just as soon as it was possible to do so, his range
              of vision being obscured by a tree located on the inside of the
              curve. He immediately called to the engineman and then got down
              on the steps preparatory to getting off. He did not see any fusee
              nor did his train explode any torpedoes, but he said he noticed
              some one leave the engine and start towards the right of way fence.<br>
              <br>
              The statements of Conductor Vallandingham and Brakeman Boren, of
              train No. 103, added nothing of importance as they were unaware
              of anything unusual until the brakes were applied in emergency
              as their train was rounding the curve south of the point of accident.<br>
              <br>
              Agent Kirksey, stationed at Westport, stated that he had no orders
              for either of the trains involved and that the train-order signal
              was in the proceed position. As train No. 330 was approaching he
              heard one long blast of the engine whistle and reported its arrival
              to the dispatcher. He then went outside and as the train approached
              the north switch of the passing track he noticed that steam was
              shut off, but shortly afterwards the engine began to work steam
              and it was still working when it passed the station, traveling
              at a speed of about 25 miles per hour. Agent Kirksey said he gave
              the engineman a hand signal indicating he as to take siding, which
              was acknowledged by the engineman by a hand signal indicating it
              was his intention to pull by and back in on the siding. It was
              then about 5 p.m. and as train No. 103 was not due out of Yuma
              until 5.02 p.m. Agent Kirksey thought there was ample time to make
              the intended movement. The air brakes were applied just after the
              caboose passed the station, but the engine appeared to work steam
              until the train came to a stop. He did not see either the conductor
              or the rear brakeman on the rear platform of the caboose as it
              passed him, but after the train stopped he saw both of them on
              the ground signalling the engineman to back up. The train stood
              at this point fully four minutes before it moved, and then three
              attempt, were made to back the train, which appeared to him to
              have been efforts to take up the slack, before it was finally started.
              The caboose had reached a point on the passing track about clear
              of the main track when he heard train No. 103 whistle for the station,
              followed very closely by the occurrence of the accident. Agent
              Kirksey was certain that he did not see a flagman proceed in either
              direction after train No. 330 had been brought to a stop, being
              particularly alert for movements of this kind in view of the existing
              situation, nor did he hear a whistle signal for flag protection.
              After the accident the engineman of train No. 330 was brought to
              the station and upon inquiry the engineman said that he thought
              he had plenty of time in which to back his train into clear. At
              the request of the engineman his watch was removed from his pocket
              and it was found to have stopped at 5.08.<br>
              <br>
              Conclusions<br>
              <br>
              This accident was caused by the failure of Engineman Wood, of train
              No. 330, to head his train in at the north switch of the passing
              track at Westport to meet an opposing superior train; a contributing
              cause was the failure of Head Brakeman Keeton properly to protect
              the head end of his train by flag.<br>
              <br>
              The rules require that at meeting points inferior trains must clear
              the main track at least five minutes before the leaving time of
              superior trains, and they also require that inferior trains must,
              when practicable, pull in at the nearest switch. The reason for
              the failure of Engineman Wood to head his train in at the north
              switch of the passing track could not be ascertained. It seemed
              apparent, however, that he was a aware his train was to meet train
              No. 103 at that point, for not only did the conductor say he gave
              the engineman a stop signal, but he was informed by both the fireman
              and the head brakeman that train No. 103 was to be met at that
              point, while the agent said the engineman gave him a hand signal
              indicating that he was going to pull by and back in on the passing
              track. What benefit could have been derived from a movement of
              this kind is problematical as there was nothing in the way of cars
              on the passing track, the length of his own train, or adverse grade
              conditions, which would have warranted this movement.<br>
              <br>
              The evidence was conflicting as to how long train No. 330 had been
              standing after it was brought to a stop south of the south switch
              and as to what protection, if any, was afforded while it was standing
              at this point. Without discussing the matter in detail, it seems
              clear that train No. 330 must have stopped not later than 5.02
              p.m., possibly at 5.01 p.m., and that Head Brakeman Keeton had
              time enough, even after allowing for his conversation with the
              engineman, to have gone a considerable distance around the curve
              before train No. 103 approached; in fact, had he gone out a distance
              of 1,320 feet he would have reached the beginning of a tangent
              which is 4,465 feet in length and would have been visible both
              to the engineman and to the fireman of train No. 103. Under these
              circumstances it is believed that had Head Brakeman Keeton utilized
              the time at his disposal it is probable that the accident would
              have been averted.<br>
              <br>
              Had an adequate automatic block-signal system been in use, this
              accident probably would not have occurred; an adequate automatic
              train stop or train control device would have prevented it.<br>
              <br>
              The employees involved were experienced men and at the time of
              the accident none of them had been on duty in violation of any
              of the provisions of the hours of service law.<br>
