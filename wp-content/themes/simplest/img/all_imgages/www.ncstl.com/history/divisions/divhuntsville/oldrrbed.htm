            <p><strong><em>by Bob Baudendistel</em></strong></p>
            <p>The Decatur, Chesapeake &amp; New Orleans (DC&amp;NO) Railway Company 
              was founded on July 20, 1887. The plan was to construct a rail line 
              from Decatur, Alabama running in a northeast direction passing through 
              Fayetteville and then on the reach Gallatin. Approximately 17 miles 
              of the proposed route would be built through the north and western 
              sections of Madison County. Only 25% of the total project was ever 
              completed, and turned out to be rather short lived.</p>
            <p>Early promoters of the rail line worked to raise money through 
              stock subscriptions. Dr. G.C. Sandusky was elected as director for 
              the railroad. $200,000 was then raised with money paid out by the 
              City of Shelbyville, Tennessee and through other private subscriptions. 
              An additional $150,000 was later subscribed by Lincoln County, but 
              with the condition that rail service would operate over the line 
              within two years, or by September 10, 1889. Despite this condition, 
              the construction and grade work for the new railroad did not start 
              up until June 6, 1889. Work was done very quickly and eagerly to 
              beat the deadline and the resulting roadbed fell into a state of 
              disrepair soon thereafter. The lack of any initial service from 
              the rail line was partly due to its poor condition and caused the 
              company to default on subscription balances which it now owed interest. 
              This resulted in a foreclosure followed by an order from the State 
              of Tennessee to sell off the line. No bids were immediately declared, 
              so a second attempt was made to auction the rail line in two segments, 
              one in Tennessee and the other in Alabama. </p>
            <p>On January 2, 1893, the entire DC&amp;NO Railroad was finally sold 
              for the price of $100,000. Mr. J. Edward Simons headed the group 
              that bought the property and assets. The rail line was re-incorporated 
              under the new name of The Middle Tennessee &amp; Alabama (MT&amp;A) 
              Railroad. To many, this name seemed more appropriate than the original. 
              The construction of the rail line on the stretch between Fayetteville 
              and Shelbyville was nearly completed during original work efforts, 
              but several bridges and trestles over major creeks and rivers were 
              deemed unsafe for rail movement. In 1897, construction efforts ceased 
              along this section of the line, leaving only the part that ran southwest 
              of Fayetteville and into Madison County, Alabama. This operation 
              would stem from a Fayetteville rail yard along the existing Nashville, 
              Chattanooga, and St. Louis (NC&amp;StL) Railroad branch line that 
              came over from Elora and Decherd.</p>
            <p>Efforts to rebuild the MT&amp;A railroad from Fayetteville into 
              Madison County were fairly successful. Under the direction of Mr. 
              James Rodes, the Cumberland Construction Company out of Fayetteville 
              succeeded in getting the rail line in operable condition. The first 
              bale of cotton was shipped successfully over the railroad on September 
              17, 1896. Soon after, regularly scheduled mixed trains were running 
              out of Fayetteville approximately 27.4 miles south to reach Madison 
              Crossroads (Toney), Alabama. Despite the renowned success, the MT&amp;A 
              fared no better financially than the DC&amp;NO. The MT&amp;A defaulted 
              on the interest of two bonds, and soon after, the rail line was 
              sold once again.</p>
            <p>On May 5, 1897, Mr. Joseph Dickson of St. Louis, Missouri purchased 
              the 27.4 mile rail line and assets for a price of $150,000. On October 
              13, 1897, Dickson sold the rail line to the NC&amp;StL for a sizable 
              profit. Following this purchase, NC&amp;StL had to temporarily suspend 
              the rail operations from Fayetteville to Madison Cross Roads in 
              order to make the needed repairs. The original goal of connecting 
              with the Memphis and Charleston Railroad at the Decatur Junction 
              never materialized. This may have been partly due to the fact that 
              the Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N) Railroad was now the majority 
              stock holder of the NC&amp;StL. Since the L&amp;N Railroad already 
              had a mainline rail connection to Decatur from Nashville, the need 
              for another north-south rail corridor was quickly dismissed.</p>
            <p>NC&amp;StL did extend the former MT&amp;A another 10 miles south 
              of Madison Cross Roads to reach the community of Capshaw. This terminal 
              point marked the end of the line and was only about 15 miles short 
              of reaching Decatur. For quite some time, the passenger service 
              along the line was operated only as far south as the community of 
              Harvest. Later, passenger service was continued along the remaining 
              6 miles to Capshaw. Freight deliveries included cotton, timber, 
              corn, hay, livestock, and nursery stock. Passenger service was often 
              scheduled to help serve many of the nearby schools, primarily those 
              around Fayetteville.</p>
            <p>Due to the use of lighter weight rail, light ballast, and several 
              weak bridges, only the smallest locomotives could be used along 
              the rail line. This limited the total tonnage of freight that could 
              be safely handled. Upon departure from the station and yard in Fayetteville, 
              the rail line had numerous curves as it generally followed the path 
              of the Elk River before crossing over using a through-truss bridge. 
              From here, the line followed a tributary of the river to reach the 
              community of Cold Water. Just south of here, the train would encounter 
              a 2% grade for a distance of approximately 3 miles before reaching 
              a summit at the community of Taft. Upon entering Madison County, 
              Alabama shortly thereafter, the rail line was fairly level and straight 
              with very few curves along the remainder of the way to Capshaw.</p>
            <p>Stations and flag stops along the railroad from Fayetteville to 
              Capshaw included: Harmes, Tillman, De Ford, Sumner, Hobbs, Cold 
              Water, Blanche, Taft, Akers, Elkwood, Bobo, Ready, Madison Cross 
              Roads (Toney), Harvest (Jeff), Coalton, Clark, and finally Capshaw. 
              Some of the busier and more populated communities along the railroad 
              featured a typical NC&amp;StL depot with an agent&#8217;s office, 
              freight rooms, and passenger waiting areas. Many of the stops however 
              were only marked by the use of carbodies (stationary rail cars) 
              that acted as a temporary makeshift depot.</p>
            <p>The 1920s brought about a sharp decline in the number of passengers 
              and total freight tonnage. The timber industry had quickly exhausted 
              its resources, leaving only smaller loads of cotton, hay, livestock, 
              and other agricultural commodities to be shipped. The advent of 
              paved roads allowed over-the-road transport to gain an even larger 
              share of the transportation market. As a result, on July 21, 1928, 
              NC&amp;StL applied with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) 
              to discontinue rail service along the former MT&amp;A railroad including 
              all 37 miles from Fayetteville to Capshaw. By March 8, 1929, the 
              ICC granted permission. It was then on April 20, 1929 that the last 
              train to use the rail line rolled into Fayetteville bringing with 
              it all of the rolling stock and other equipment that was used along 
              the line. </p>
            <p>The short-lived history of the MT&amp;A Railroad is an example 
              of a railroad branch line operation that simply had no place to 
              go. With little business and industry along the line, any long-term 
              success would have only been possible with more track-miles, better 
              connections with the other rail lines, and more commerce. On April 
              20, 1929, the NC&amp;StL Railroad Company sold the property and 
              roadbed running through Madison County to the County Highway Department 
              with a quitclaim deed. Today, the roadbed is marked as a two-lane 
              roadway that continues to serve as a vital link in the modern day-to-day 
              transportation network, and carries the seemingly appropriate name 
              &#8220;Old Railroad Bed Road&#8221;.<br>
