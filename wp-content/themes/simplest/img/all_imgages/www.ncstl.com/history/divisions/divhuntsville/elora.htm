            <p><strong><em>by Bob Baudendistel</em></strong></p>
            <p>During the summer of 1886, parties interested in the new Huntsville 
              Railroad were confident that they could raise the required $40,000 
              subscription. By September of that year, the money had been secured, 
              and hope was that the construction would soon begin with the new 
              railroad to Huntsville. Several key prospectors from the area formed 
              a local committee at Huntsville. Their efforts were intended to 
              stimulate more trade and economic boost for Huntsville and Madison 
              County. Headed by Milton Humes, they traveled to Nashville to help 
              with the money subscriptions. On October 9, 1886, the Board of Directors 
              of Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N) Railroad Company met in Nashville. 
              Representing their controlling interest in the Nashville, Chattanooga, 
              and St. Louis (NC&amp;StL) Railroad Company, they voted unanimously 
              in favor of any action taken by the NC&amp;StL to begin with the 
              construction of a rail line leading from Elora, Tennessee to Huntsville, 
              Alabama. L&amp;N President John W. Thomas called a special meeting 
              with the NC&amp;StL Board of Directors to make final arrangements 
              in reference to the matter. Once all subscription balances were 
              paid and the final deed descriptions were entered into the Madison 
              County probate records, construction was permitted on Huntsville&#8217;s 
              new connection to Nashville. </p>
            <p>Work efforts were soon underway with at least 500 hired hands. 
              The goal was to push the workers hard in an effort to reach an earlier 
              then expected completion date with the construction of the railroad. 
              Some of the names of the families and landowners who bargained, 
              sold, and conveyed the lands required to build the railroad included 
              Petty, Steele, Yarbrough, Fanning, Bostick, Stewart, Douglas, Hawk, 
              Davis, Nuchols, Mastin, Penny, Kelly, Chapman, O&#8217;Shaughnessy, 
              and many more. Many of these individuals were prospectors of the 
              plan to help Huntsville prosper and as the Huntsville Gazette put 
              it, &#8220;not be left in the dust&#8221;. By February 5, 1887, 
              all deeds and legal descriptions to the property from all of the 
              required landowners were sent to the office of probate records at 
              the county courthouse to be entered in the deed record books. The 
              county court clerk was being hit with bundles of these deed records, 
              and soon, more help would be needed for them to make quick work 
              with the entries. This same date, word was that the contractors, 
              Holmes and Davis, were already concentrating their work forces at 
              Elora, where a construction train brought in the required dump carts, 
              live stock, picks, shovels, and excavators from up in Nashville. 
              Dirt would soon be flying as work was finally underway with Huntsville&#8217;s 
              new gateway to wealth.</p>
            <p>The newly completed railroad would operate under the ownership 
              and management of the NC&amp;StL Railroad Company. This &#8220;Huntsville 
              Branch&#8221; operation of NC&amp;StL was highly successful for 
              the railroad. The branch operation started out of Decherd, Tennessee 
              stemming from the NC&amp;StL Mainline track. The branch operation 
              ran along much of what was once the Winchester and Alabama (W&amp;A) 
              Railroad. This railroad had previously been built out of Decherd, 
              Tennessee in 1852, through the county seat of Winchester, and then 
              to Elora. The original plan was for this W&amp;A rail line to be 
              built to reach Huntsville, but a lack of funding forced the money-strickened 
              railroad to detour the line instead over to Fayetteville. The W&amp;A 
              was later ripped apart during the course of the civil war. Following 
              the war, the State of Tennessee foreclosed on the W&amp;A rail line. 
              It was not until 1877 that the NC&amp;StL bought the W&amp;A Railroad 
              from the state, and soon after, Huntsville would finally see its 
              connection.</p>
            <p>In route from Elora to Huntsville, the path of the railroad followed 
              very much of the same route as you can travel over today along Winchester 
              Road. Several flag stops and stations were located along the rail 
              line between Elora and Huntsville. These included Steele Crossing, 
              Plevna, New Market, Fanning Crossing, Deposit, Bell Factory, Mercury, 
              Chase, Normal, and finally Huntsville. The railroad crossed over 
              many of the larger creeks and rivers. The original trestle over 
              the Flint River was built using wooden trusses and cut stone piers. 
              This structure was soon replaced with additional concrete piers 
              and open-deck steel girders. During the construction of the rail 
              line, a temporary junction with the Memphis and Charleston (M&amp;C) 
              Railroad (today&#8217;s Norfolk Southern) was built at what would 
              later become known as Chase. This point was referred to as the &#8220;Fearn&#8221; 
              Switch, and marked the very first junction of two major railroads 
              in the history of Huntsville and Madison County. Once the construction 
              of the NC&amp;StL was completed the remaining distance into Huntsville, 
              the Fearn Switch was removed. The arrival point at Huntsville along 
              The NC&amp;StL formed a junction with the M&amp;C. The NC&amp;StL 
              railroad came in around a curve located behind the current location 
              of the former Dilworth Lumber Company building on Church Street. 
              Part of the same track is still visible today, and is presently 
              being used to store maintenance-of-way equipment.</p>
            <p>During the 1950&#8217;s, the entire NC&amp;StL rail system was 
              transitioned to operate under the full name, ownership and management 
              of the L&amp;N. By 1985, CSX Transportation Inc. had controlling 
              interest. The last revenue train to run over the line from Elora 
              to Huntsville was in 1985. Five miles of this rail line have been 
              restored by volunteers with The North Alabama Railroad Museum (NARM), 
              a chapter of the National Railway Historical Society (NRHS). The 
              Madison County Water Authority owns a remaining large portion of 
              the property and roadbed running through the northeastern sections 
              of the county. The museum operates a train excursion out of Chase 
              over the restored 5 miles of track that it owns. The headquarters 
              for the museum is located at the Chase Depot, which was built to 
              serve as a union depot with both the M&amp;C and NC&amp;StL. For 
              museum schedules and ticket information, call (256) 851-6276, or
