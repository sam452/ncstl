            <p><strong><em>by Bob Baudendistel</em></strong></p>
            <p>At eight o&#8217;clock one evening in April, 1892, Milton Humes, 
              Chairman of the Board of Trade, called a town meeting with Huntsville 
              area citizens to discuss the transportation problems that plagued 
              many of the communities south of the city towards the Tennessee 
              River. The proposition before the panel at this public hearing was 
              centered on convincing the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis 
              (NC&amp;StL) Railroad Company to extend its Elora-Huntsville rail 
              line. This extension of the railroad would be built running south 
              of Huntsville to reach the Tennessee River at or near the head of 
              Hobbs Island, a distance of approximately 14 miles. Many prospectors 
              believed that this &#8220;Southern Outlet&#8221; was needed in order 
              for the Huntsville economy to continue to thrive. The committee 
              voted unanimously to submit the proposition, and as a result, subscriptions 
              totaling more than $6950 were immediately declared. </p>
            <p>It was on Monday, May 21, 1892 when the first survey for the rail 
              line to Hobbs Island took place. Mr. Hunter McDonald, who was the 
              active superintendent of the Western and Atlantic Division of the 
              NC&amp;StL Railroad, began laying out the preliminary lines for 
              the new road. Mr. McDonald employed Thompson Jones, Leslie Donegan, 
              Norman Figures, and several other locals to assist him with the 
              effort. Following the preliminary survey efforts, a later meeting 
              was held on Friday, June 25 when additional subscriptions were noted. 
              One subscription was for the sum of $500 from The City of Huntsville. 
              Soon after, on July 1, 1892, two carloads of scrapers and other 
              grading tools were brought to Huntsville by train along the existing 
              NC&amp;StL Elora-Huntsville Railroad. Meanwhile, more grading tools 
              were said to have arrived by boat at Whitesburg. </p>
            <p>Once all of the required fee-simple deeds to the property were 
              secured and entered into the probate records at the county courthouse, 
              the construction of the rail line was permitted. Some of the names 
              of the individuals or families who bargained, sold, and conveyed 
              the property required for this extension of the railroad to Hobbs 
              Island include Humes, Teal, Ewing, Garth, Harris, Moore, Beirne, 
              Matthews, Brown, White, Proctor, Farley, Burrow, Campbell, Logan, 
              Taylor, and Hobbs. By November 1892, most of the line was graded 
              and the tracklayers had reached a point nearly six miles south of 
              the city. Once completed, this would put yet another extension on 
              the map for the Huntsville Branch operation of the NC&amp;StL Railroad. 
              Prior to this event, The Tennessee and Coosa (T&amp;C) Railroad 
              Company was attempting to build a railroad through Marshall and 
              Etowah Counties. It was back in 1845 when Gen. Andrew Jackson first 
              initiated the construction of this railroad to provide a vital artery 
              across Sand Mountain between the two namesake rivers. The construction 
              of this railroad was very slow, and never actually completed until 
              1893 when the NC&amp;StL bought the property and assets. This left 
              a remaining 20 mile watery gap between Hobbs Island and Gunters 
              Landing. To overcome the rugged mountains and river valley, NC&amp;StL 
              built an incline at each landing, and transferred the railroad cars 
              up and down the river atop wooden barges. The barges were pushed 
              using two flat-bottomed paddle-wheel steamers Huntsville and Guntersville. 
              Passengers would get to board these steamers during the journey 
              along the river. This obscure marine operation was maintained by 
              the railroad before, during, and after the construction of Guntersville 
              Dam that was completed in 1939.</p>
            <p>The Huntsville Branch line of the NC&amp;StL now operated more 
              than 100 miles of track from a point-of-beginning in Decherd, Tennessee. 
              The line terminated at a switchyard in Gadsden. This allowed Huntsville 
              business and industry to reach markets spreading across southern 
              parts of the state. The railroad timetable included daily passenger 
              and freight runs. Early steam locomotives included the classic American 
              4-4-0&#8217;s. Later, 2-8-0 Husky Consolidations, 2-10-0 Russian 
              Decapods, and 4-6-0 Baldwin Ten-Wheelers were the norm. The earliest 
              freight cars, passenger cars, and cabooses were of the wooden variety. 
              These were gradually replaced with the more modern equipment featuring 
              all-steel construction. By the mid 1950&#8217;s, diesel locomotives 
              replaced the aging steam fleet. The steamboats and wooden river 
              barges used for the river ferry transfer operation were replaced 
              with the diesel tugboat Guntersville, and two new all-steel river 
              barges.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>While in route to Hobbs Island from downtown Huntsville, several 
              stations and flag stops were located along the line. These included 
              Lily Flagg, Matthew&#8217;s Place, Farley, Burrows, Taylorsville, 
              and finally Hobbs Island. The Huntsville &amp; Madison County Railroad 
              Authority currently operates a train along 90% of this very same 
              rail line that is visible while driving over much of South Memorial 
              Parkway.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the busiest time ever for the Huntsville Branch operation 
              of the NC&amp;StL came as a result of the Huntsville Arsenal. Safe 
              and reliable transportation with the U.S. Army warfare and munitions 
              center at the arsenal was vital to the successful U.S. involvement 
              in World War II. Two of the three rail spurs leading on to the Huntsville 
              Arsenal were built directly from this southern extension of the 
              NC&amp;StL. One spur was built close to where Vermont Road is found 
              running today west of Memorial Parkway near the Martin Road interchange. 
              A second spur was built leading onto the arsenal from a siding down 
              at Farley near the current location of Green Cove Road. This switch 
              point at Farley would later become known as the Rocket Siding. As 
              the space and missile programs landed their operations on the newly 
              formed Redstone Arsenal, the need for rail service declined somewhat 
              over the years. It was during the late 1950&#8217;s when L&amp;N 
              had taken over the full ownership, management, and operation of 
              the entire NC&amp;StL rail system, including the Huntsville Branch. 
              In 1957, L&amp;N ceased the river ferry transfer operation between 
              Hobbs Island and Guntersville since the company already had access 
              into Gadsden through its other rail lines that came from Birmingham 
              and Anniston. Today, there is still some visible evidence of where 
              the river ferry incline was operated along the banks of the Tennessee 
              River near Hobbs Island. This point is upstream approximately &frac12; 
              mile from the head of the island past The Baker Sand and Gravel 
              Company. The launch point at Gunters Landing is still evident today 
              as well. It is hidden in a tree line that is behind the Harbor House 
              Restaurant and Marina off of Highway 431 just south of the river 
              bridge.</p>
            <p>Declining business and mounting expenses with many of the original 
              NC&amp;StL branch lines such as the Huntsville Branch forced CSX 
              Transportation to discontinue the service from many of them back 
              in the 1980&#8217;s. This prompted the newly formed Huntsville &amp; 
              Madison County Railroad Authority to purchase the rail line leading 
              from downtown Huntsville to Norton as many of the industries along 
              the route required rail service. The next time you are driving through 
              parts of south Huntsville, chances are, you may witness the passing 
              of an EMD SW locomotive pulling a string of freight cars. Only now, 
              you&#8217;ll know more about how the rail service was first brought 
              to the area, how important it was, and continues to be.<br>
